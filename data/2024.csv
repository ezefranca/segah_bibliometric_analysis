In such scenarios, critically ill individuals require hospitalization and treatment by specialized intensive care teams. With the support of increasingly intelligent, personalized, and assertive computing technologies, health professionals can reach hospitalized patients to make decisions, even when the disease involves a high risk of contamination. This work presents a new remote cyber-physical patient monitoring system using Computer Vision technologies for decision-making support of the health team mainly working in Intensive Care Units. The system can assist hospitalized patients by continuously and contactlessly monitoring their vital functions from the screen of any multiparametric monitor model, thus being monitor-agnostic. Moreover, in support of such situations, it can alert and detect critical problems before they deteriorate and help provide comprehensive care with minimal doctor-patient interaction.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639578","UNIFOR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639578","remote patient monitoring;cyber-physical system;computer vision;mobile alert application","Computers;Patient monitoring;Computer vision;Infectious diseases;Computational modeling;Decision making;Medical services","","","","36","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patients performed a cognitive task, i.e., they did the shopping in an ad-hoc developed VR application wearing a head-mounted display. Questionnaires on anxiety, technology acceptance, flow, and cybersickness were proposed. According to the patients’ response, the VR-based cognitive training was well tolerated: anxiety remained stable, the flow state and variables related to acceptability achieved medium-high scores, and symptoms of cybersickness were minimal.

This study presents sophisticated predictive models that use noninvasive monitoring technology and shapelet-based feature extraction from heart and breathing rate data to capture physiological signals indicative of hypoglycemic episodes. The core objective was to harness the descriptiveness of non-invasive physiological time-series data with the robust predictive capabilities of machine learning for T1D management. To achieve this, we implemented and evaluated three machine learning classifiers: support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifiers (RFC), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We also leveraged shapelets to extract distinct, patient-specific physiological patterns indicative of hypoglycemic episodes. The proposed method involves comprehensive preprocessing of physiological sensor data from the D1NAMO dataset, extracting shapelet features characteristic of hypoglycemic events, and iterative classifier optimization modeling. The performance metrics—including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score—were estimated to evaluate each model’s effectiveness.The results indicate that the CNN model outperformed the other models, achieving 76% accuracy, 77% precision, and a 0.76 F1-score for hypoglycemia detection. The SVM and RFC models also demonstrated substantial capabilities, underpinning their potential use in clinical settings. In conclusion, the integration of shapelet-based feature extraction into machine learning frameworks can significantly advance personalized hypoglycemia prediction and demonstrate a promising avenue for enhancing noninvasive diabetes monitoring techniques for patients with T1D, thereby setting the stage for extended research and refinement in this vital healthcare domain.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639605","Hypoglycemia Prediction;Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus;Noninvasive Monitoring;Shapelet-Based Feature Extraction;Physiological Signal Processing;Wearable Sensors;Machine Learning","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Data models;Diabetes","","1","","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was rapidly developed using components of other dPHE projects and released in May 2020, garnering more than 1400 unique users across the world that recorded their activities over the course of 2 years. Activity records had high granularity, providing details on the type of activity, the time the user did it, their satisfaction with it, and their answers to some follow-up questions (e.g. activity location, whether it was online or virtual). Daily reporting was encouraged by three gamification features: (i) social media competition, (ii) badges, and (iii) a self-evaluative “analytics” page. The app design and deployment are both presented in this paper alongside an evaluation of its gamification features. Overall, My Lockdown Journal demonstrated that journaling and activity recording provided valuable support to users while also generating a rich dataset of human behaviour during lockdowns that can be used to inform public health policy in the next pandemic.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639532","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology; Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639532","COVID-19;Human Behaviour;Journaling;Gamification;Android App","COVID-19;Data analysis;Pandemics;Social networking (online);Mental health;Emergency services;Recording","","","","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the technical setups of Embodied Perspective-Taking in a medical communication training application. Embodying a Doctor avatar, participants delivered bad news to an angry (virtual) parent that her child’s surgery had unfortunately been cancelled due to an emergency. They were then able to review their performance in VR, from either the parent’s (1st person) or a dis-embodied 3rd person’s perspective on self-efficacy. We conducted a between-group study with 16 medical professionals recruited from a paediatric hospital and found no significant impact of perspective. However, when taking into consideration the participants’ roles and experience, we found that Nurses underwent a notable change in self-evaluation compared to Doctors after experiencing their review in VR, and reported more levels of Nervousness speaking to the parent.

One example is the WII Balance Board (WBB), or Home Balance Posturography, a computerized tool to examine balance in home environments. Using virtual reality (VR) technology with balanced assessment tools may enhance the instruments’ ecological validity, increase performance and standardization, and reduce administration time. We created a VR-based Cable Car simulation (CCS) using a WBB for the balance assessment with four different speeds and five angles of the Cable Car. The 23 participants participated in this study using a repeated measures sample design. The participants first experienced Cable Car Simulation and then the posturography test (mCTSIB).The maximum excursion of Center of Pressure (COP), usability and participants’ level of presence were measured through WBB, SUS, and Witmer and Singer Presence instruments, respectively. Results showed no impact of the angles of the Cable Car on the maximum excursion of COP of participants. However, a significant difference was found on COP in the anterior-posterior axis when the speed of the Cables was increased three times. We found a positive correlation between the mean speed from CCS and the Posturography test. No correlation was found between the maximum excursion of COPs for the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. The sense of presence score was moderate, while the usability score was good.

High levels of adherence should lead to greater effects of the intervention; the greater fidelity to the protocol, the more benefit one should receive from the protocol. Further, this delivery mechanism supports just-in-time “micro” interventions, or smaller yet more frequent dosages of skill practice. mHealth has limitations in these areas; the ability of patients to sustainably adhere to a protocol, and to drive intervention effect sizes. This research considers personalized just-in-time adaptive micro-interventions as a potential remedy to these limitations. Specifically, in the context of a pediatric anxiety protocol, we introduce an approach to drive greater levels of adherence and effect sizes by incorporating per-patient information. This approach has been implemented within an mHealth app for middle school that was successfully pilot-tested in the Phoenix area. The number of users is small (n=3) so a case-by-case analysis of app usage is presented.

It has the potential to influence immersion and effectiveness of the VR experience. This research investigates MO and how our brains react to locomotion in VR, generally motivated by an interest in neurological considerations when integrating locomotion within an experience, either for social or medical purposes, such as rehabilitation. The investigation explores and compares VR locomotion techniques through mu rhythm desynchronization, shedding light on the underlying neural processes associated with motor resonance in the context of VR-mediated MO. Through a detailed experimental approach, incorporating Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, the study examines neural responses elicited by three VR locomotion techniques: Arm Swinger (AS), Sliding Joystick (SJ), and Short Teleport (ST), employing sophisticated filtering methodology to isolate and analyze neural signals, minimizing artifacts from head and arm movements through velocity-based adaptive filtering and support vector classifiers for Electrooculography (EOG) noise reduction to enhances the precision of mu rhythm desynchronization analysis. Findings highlight significant variations in mu rhythm suppression across these techniques, illustrating the complex link between VR movement methods and their neural correlates in the motor cortex and showed a significant difference in mu suppression levels during MO of locomotion techniques, indicating that motor resonance of voluntary movement in VR is influenced by how that motion is perceived. Finally, this research suggests employing this method in conjunction with other cognitive and psychological metrics to assess the impact of VR experience on individuals.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639584","Virtual Reality;Desynchronization;Electroencephalography;Motor Area;Mu Rhythm;Observed Movement","Electrooculography;Filtering;Psychology;Virtual reality;Rhythm;Motors;Resonance","","","","31","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results of this second research thrust will enable future researchers to study how attention and concentration affects the behavior of stuttering individuals. This research examines how Virtual Reality (VR) environments can help adolescents and young adults reduce stuttering, which affects their speech fluency, confidence, and social interactions. While traditional stuttering treatments provide certain advantages, they often fall short in helping in the transition to real-life communication scenarios. In this study, three immersive VR environments have been created for therapeutic purposes where participants can practice speaking. The methods adopted seek to reduce stuttering, reduce anxiety, and improve communication skills in a simulated “life like” group settings. Therapy sessions used three VR scenarios developed with Unity and Oculus Rift to mimic real communication challenges. The results showed that VR therapy effectively reduced stuttering, decreased anxiety, and improved confidence in speaking. This represents a significant advancement in stuttering treatment. Most participants observed a decrease in the occurrence of stuttering and feedback emphasized the therapy’s engaging and beneficial nature.

Instances during the COVID-19 pandemic and in Virtual Reality (VR) environments highlight these challenges, where mask usage and head-mounted displays obstruct facial features critical for accurate recognition. This paper aims to investigate the importance of the eyes in facial expression recognition by using four models: ResNet-18, VGG-19, EfficientNet-B1, and an Ensemble model. Utilising the FERPlus dataset, scenarios with and without occlusion were examined. In scenarios without occlusion, ResNet-18 emerged as the top-performing model, achieving 86.1% accuracy. However, when occluded by goggles, the Ensemble model demonstrated superior performance with 82.8% accuracy. Furthermore, in the presence of mask occlusion, EfficientNet-B1 exhibited the most robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 71.2%.

In particular, VR is showing promise in scenarios that are difficult or impossible to replicate in real life due to physical constraints related to specialized equipment or facilities, and health hazards for trainees. This scenario is typical in nuclear energy training, where trainees are required to locate and manipulate radiation sources. Traditionally, radiation source manipulation is taught using safe radiation sources in laboratory settings, where trainees use a Geiger-Müller counter to detect and measure ionizing radiation to locate a radiation source in the least possible time to reduce radiation exposure. However, such an approach is not cost-effective and exposes trainees to radiation. This paper presents the development of a VR radiation source location scenario in which skin response and heart rate modify the flashing frequency and audio intensity of an emergency light and a siren, respectively. The main goal is to better understand how physiologically-driven audiovisual changes impact usability, cognitive load, and anxiety when locating hidden radiation sources. Our preliminary results indicate that the modification of audiovisual cues affects usability, cognitive load, anxiety, and completion time.

However, recent advancements in wearable technology, notably heart rate monitors, have revolutionized this process. This study leverages a game-based Cardiac Assessment Protocol, designed to simulate a exercise protocol using a wearable chest strap integrated with an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and accelerometer for estimation of VO2max. With a cohort comprising 22 subjects, the study focused on extracting features from both Heart Rate (HR) and acceleration data collected during Cardiac Assessment Protocol and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) utilising the wearable chest strap. The ground truth for VO2max was derived from CPET. The Machine Learning (ML) model yielded VO2max predictions from HR data collected during CPET with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.37 compared with the ground truth COSMED VO2max data. Similarly, when VO2max was estimated from the HR data during the Cardiac Assessment Protocol, the model had a RMSE of 5.82 compared to the ground truth COSMED VO2max data. These results indicated that VO2max can be reasonably estimated from HR and acceleration data under a simulated incremental game-based Cardiac Assessment Protocol, providing a potential alternative to traditional exercise testing methods. Notwithstanding this, the proposed protocol demonstrates promising potential for VO2max estimation through a less invasive and more accessible approach to cardiovascular fitness assessment.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639555","VO2max;Cardiac Assessment;HR;CPET;Game","Heart rate;Protocols;Life estimation;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Data models;Serious games","","","","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills.

Environmental surveillance agents, tasked with conducting routine entomological surveys in regions burdened with infective mosquitoes play an essential role in vector surveillance. Digital intervention, through mobile phone technology, offers the potential to augment mosquito surveillance efforts by overcoming the limitations inherent in traditional paper-based data collection methods. This public health informatics study introduces a multi-profile mobile application designed to enhance the process of data collection from mosquito ovitraps, ensure timely reporting, and improve field worker performance in Madeira Island, with an emphasis on user-centred design. The application seeks to boost operational efficiency for field agents and to streamline decision-making processes for health authorities. It explores the technical design, user experience, and architecture, alongside the challenges faced during implementation, including logistical hurdles during adaptation. Crucially, this research considers the varied on-groundchallenges encountered by agents, such as fears of data loss or errors in entry, which add complexity to the digital transition. The transition to a digitised data collection system is poised to have a significant impact which could facilitate the timely use of predictive analytical models to forecast mosquito population dynamics, enabling the early detection of hotspots. This, in turn, would allow fieldworker agents to be alerted to immediate action and direct their efforts to high-risk areas, significantly improving the efficiency of interventions against mosquito-borne diseases.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639531","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639531","digital intervention;mobile application;real-time;mosquito surveillance;ovitraps","Surveillance;Data collection;Aerodynamics;Vectors;Real-time systems;Mobile handsets;User experience","","","","19","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this study was to develop a new motor coordination test, verify its correlation with the Box and Blocks Test and the Tapping Test and evaluate its usability. A sample of 12 volunteers aged 23-53 took part in the study. It was found that the test developed does not correlate directly with traditional tests, possibly indicating that different skills are required. However, there was a significant correlation between the Tapping Test and the Box and Blocks Test, which could suggest an equivalent correspondence between them. Finally, according to the System Usability Scale score, the system was evaluated as “Best Imaginable” (score of 87.5), indicating it is viable for an application.

The methodology used is based on the Futures Design Toolkit, which plays a crucial role in shaping the future of design by empowering individuals and enhancing future literacy. In the first phases of the design process, trends and drivers for change were identified, interpreted, and categorized to understand the researched topic. A toolkit called Future Philosophical Pills was adopted to explore future spaces in a playful way. At this point, the project’s aim was identified and the various repercussions, both at an individual and social level, were mapped. To generate contrasting possibilities, a polarity mapping tool was employed to pinpoint scenarios, while a fictional persona of the selected scenario was described to imagine how this actor would look like and how would he interact with the surrounding context. Finally, three wearables were provo-typed, a term coined from the fusion of prototype and provoke: the “Hug and Relief” vest, the “Breathe with Me” raincoat and the “Calming Heartbeat” necklace. The modular vest was inspired by the transformative power of hugging, a gesture of affection and compassion. The lighted raincoat emerged as a supportive tool designed to guide breathing through visual stimulation, while the vibrating necklace searched to replicate the sensation of calm and security experienced when in close contact with another person whose heart rate is calmed. Additionally, the three pieces were made from reused highly polluting materials to reinforce the possibility of a harmonious coexistence between design, health, and environmental practices. The goal of this research, when it reaches its final state, is to explore the benefits of these wearables in mental health and their effectiveness to provide people with tangible tools to ease anxiety and cultivate a greater awareness of themselves.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639591","Health wearables;mental health;emotional support;future thinking;higher education;educational innovation;professional education","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Visualization;Clothing;Anxiety disorders;Prototypes;Electroencephalography","","","","24","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some research on their most effective features has shown that anthropomorphism improves trustworthiness and adherence to treatment. However, it has been suggested that non-humanoid agents, or even non-embodied ones, can be used in tasks involving personal disclosure or information recall. After our literature review, some questions arose regarding the best features for an agent in the role of an active listener for women to disclose complex life events: Would a human-like or non-humanoid visual be better received? And if representing a human, how relevant would it be for the agent to speak? To find answers, we created a speaking humanoid, a mute humanoid, and a speaking non-humanoid agent and compared them in a personal-disclosure context. In a repeated-measures experiment, 21 women roleplayed the disclosure of challenging situations with each agent. We measured their emotional responses, affinity, empathy, social presence, social closeness, and likability for the agents. Our results showed that having a human-like appearance had a significant effect on affinity (p<0.009), social presence (p<0.025), social closeness (p<0.001), and likability (p<0.031) but not on their emotional responses or levels of empathy. The humanoids’ speaking ability did not significantly affect any measures but slightly improved feelings of social closeness, identifiability, and perceived awareness.

Chest-worn wearable ECG devices help the user take regular HRV measurements enabling them to assess their cardiac recovery and readiness for training while maintaining accuracy of data. However, such self-measurements using wearables can affect data quality primarily due to non-adherence of measurement protocol.

As a result, patients can exhibit a wide range of cognitive and behavioral deficits, including difficulties with attention, learning and memory, language, emotional processing, time perception, and loss of self-activation, manifested through apathy and indifference. Information and Communication Technology-based Cognitive Training (ICT-based CT) with more ecologically valid content may be valuable in intervening with these patients. Beyond enhancing motivation and engagement, such technologies can be equipped with several features, such as cue systems and errorless learning techniques, that assist patients with severe declarative memory deficits by minimizing errors and engaging alternative non-declarative memory routes to facilitate encoding and retrieval of new information. Herein, we present a case report of LT, a 41-yearold female patient, with 10 years of formal education, diagnosed with bilateral thalamic stroke who enrolled in a one-month tablet-based CT intervention with the prototype version of the NeuroAIreh@b platform. Prior to the intervention, LT was submitted to a neuropsychological assessment to characterize her cognitive abilities, emotional state (i.e., presence and severity of depressive symptomatology), quality of life, and functional abilities. The tablet-based CT intervention encompassed eight 45-minute sessions and involved performing four types of Reh@Apps incorporating CT tasks (i.e., cancelation, categorization, action sequencing and calculation) within daily life scenarios (i.e., the kitchen and the supermarket). After the CT intervention, LT was reassessed and demonstrated reliable increases in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Digit Symbol-Coding, and the Phonemic Verbal Fluency test, suggesting improvements in global cognitive functioning, processing speed and phonemic verbal fluency, respectively. Moreover, quantitative improvements in both immediate and delayed recall trials of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test indicated a slight improvement in verbal episodic memory. Concerning the emotional status domain, LT also reported less depressive symptomatology. Throughout the rehabilitation program, LT became progressively more autonomous when performing tasks, requiring fewer cues and verbal instructions from the therapist, which enhanced her engagement, emotional stability, and self-efficacy. A three-month follow-up reassessment revealed that her cognitive and emotional status reverted to baseline values. This case report highlights the potential of a personalized tablet-based CT, not only to improve learning and compensate for memory deficits but also to foster self-efficacy and well-being in patients with severe acquired brain injuries and poor functional prognosis. Future studies should focus on optimizing patient outcomes by exploring extended ICT-based CT within a comprehensive and multicomponent rehabilitation program delivered in community settings. These programs can be implemented life-long and can incorporate both compensatory strategies training that capitalizes on implicit learning and memory, and psychosocial interventions for caregivers (e.g., emotional support, psychoeducation) to further increase the patient’s adherence and generalization of gains to everyday life.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639593","Bilateral thalamic stroke;cognitive training;interactive technologies;ecological validity","Training;Learning systems;Sequential analysis;Prototypes;Encoding;Serious games;Reliability","","","","41","EU","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of serious games in virtual reality (VR) has shown promising results in therapy for adults with Amblyopia, which was often considered significantly harder to treat. This paper reports using a VR game developed in collaboration with an Ophthalmologist to improve visual acuity in adults with Amblyopia.

However, these proposals often consolidate their focus on a single feature or measurement. In this research paper, we present a pioneering methodology for detecting depressive symptoms through the collection and analysis of multimodal measurements reflecting daily activities, including location, sleep patterns, phone usage, and duration of phone calls. Our approach involves the development of a discreet mobile application, which gathers data from participants, including location, sleep patterns, phone usage, and duration of phone calls. Additionally, our research delves into the integration of chatbot technology to address early-stage depression assessment. In addition to acquiring data from test participants, we also employed a benchmark dataset, subjecting both datasets to analysis using several anomaly detection algorithms. Our findings revealed a negative correlation between the number of visited locations and the severity of depression while using the application, and a positive correlation with the results of the PHQ-9 questionnaires and chatbot use, indicating the potential of the chatbot as a reliable tool for preliminary assessment of depressive symptoms.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639580","","Correlation;Atmospheric measurements;Chatbots;Particle measurements;Depression;Serious games;Proposals","","","","28","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergence of consumer grade AR devices provides a novel option for assessing angular estimation which may potentially be more suitable for use in routine diagnostic practice than fully immersive VR. This initial study aimed to design a simplified angular replication methodology and to ascertain the ease of use of AR technology. Twelve volunteers tested the application that required them to replicate an encoding angle using virtual markers within a real world environment. All participants successfully completed the 28 trials consistently within a similar timeframe. Spatial data from the headset provided valuable insights into performance, and questionnaire feedback indicated a positive user experience with minimal simulation sickness.

The field of serious games for people with dementia (PwD) has become a very active research area. Nevertheless, a notable portion of these endeavors lacks a robust theoretical basis. Based on the best-established guidelines for personalizing game content, using musical elements, and reminiscence therapy, we have designed a serious game for PwD – SAUDÆDE, emphasizing a person-centered care framework incorporating co-creation and customization of CS programs with and for PwD using personal and meaningful content. Here, we present data on a longitudinal randomized controlled trial where we assess the impact of SAUDÆDE on cognition, mood, functionality, and quality of life in a sample of PwD. Seven PwD went through an intervention of 12 sessions with SAUDÆDE and performed a pre- and post-neuropsychological assessment. Descriptive data analysis of the outcome measures revealed that the experimental group had an increase in general cognition and functionality. Comparatively, the control group had a reduction in functionality and general cognition and a discrete improvement in attention.

As a result, five factors were extracted as preference factors for digital game genres: “thinking and process-oriented,” “role fulfillment,” “competitiveness and results-oriented,” “instantaneous decision making,” and “story emersion.” The results revealed differences in preferences for digital game genres among non-gamers, light gamers, and heavy gamers based on their usual duration of game playing. Furthermore, differences among the groups in “role fulfillment,” “competitiveness and results-oriented,” “instantaneous decision making,” “story immersion,” “rhythm action,” and “strategy simulation” were revealed.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639606","digital games;game genres;preferences for digital games;gamification;digital game-based learning","Decision making;Focusing;Games;Rhythm;Serious games","","1","","13","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of reminiscence therapy through virtual reality technology combines sight, touch, sound, and events from past experiences. Through this non-pharmacological approach, it is hoped that PWD will recall memories of their past lives, have reduced episodes of depression and improve their quality of life as they age in place in their homes and communities. The paper reports an exploratory study that seeks the input of PWD, care partners (CP), and employees of dementia care services in enhancing a VR reminiscence therapy prototype that is being considered for integration into an existing dementia care program.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639596","virtual reality;people with dementia;caregiver;reminiscence therapy;usability;co-design","Training;Solid modeling;Refining;Medical treatment;Prototypes;Virtual reality;Serious games","","","","14","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"An Exploratory Study on Fear-Inducing Factors in Virtual Reality Experiences","J. Leichtweiß; E.

It is known for its ability to provide users with an immersive experience in virtual worlds. This can evoke intense and real emotional states, which is particularly useful in horror games. Developers of VR horror games should know about VR technology to be able to utilize the possibilities and limitations effectively for development. If the limits of the technology are not observed, this can lead to an unfavorable experience for the player and therefore to a poor rating for the game. This paper presents an exploratory study in which two VR horror games and a VR application for fear of heights were analyzed and compared in terms of the participants’ stress levels, measured with electrodermal-acitivity-sensor (EDA-sensor) and linked to the game-play recording, and their answers from the subsequent interview. The study investigates which approaches and techniques of such VR applications provide an immersive VR experience inducing fear. Based on our analysis, a list of approaches, techniques, and design guidelines could be identified that reflect the aspect of fear in VR horror games.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639579","Virtual Reality;Horror Games;Fear;Game Design","Industries;Atmospheric measurements;Design methodology;Anxiety disorders;Immersive experience;Particle measurements;Serious games","","","","26","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
