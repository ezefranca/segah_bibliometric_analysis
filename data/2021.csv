In serious games where the goal is beyond entertainment, handheld devices act as an expedient medium. The accessibility of gaming has been leveraged enhancing its scope of application in various sectors including mental health. Qualitative analysis of gameplay experience is key to perpetuate the standard of game. While it comes to serious games, the impact of gameplay experience may significantly vary depending on the personality of the player. In serious games, where the primary goal is people's cognitive, social, motivational, and emotional enhancement, analyzing this differential impact is crucial. In this paper, we have presented an analysis of the differential impact of personality traits in serious gaming context. To conduct the experiment we have adopted our previously developed game Militant of the Maze (MoM) [38] that comprises one of the efficacious strategies of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Find alternative as underlying gameplay strategy, which is used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). After conducting a large-scale user experiment and statistical analysis we have demonstrated that individual PX can be significantly impacted by the player's personality trait in a serious gaming context, which may significantly impact the efficacy of the framework to treat neonle with OCD.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551856","serious games;psychotherapeutic strategy;gameplay;player experience;Big Five Inventory(BFI)","Handheld computers;Statistical analysis;Medical treatment;Entertainment industry;Games;Mental health;Serious games","","2","","43","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are increasingly popular because they provide significant health benefits, while improving the cognitive functions. Similarly, to other software tools, these solutions need to assess their quality, to be later improved. However, there are not contributions that allow the quality evaluation specifically related to the usability and portability characteristics. Therefore, this paper presents, first, an evaluation method aligned to the ISO/IEC 25040 standard, its activities, and artifacts which will be used for the serious game's quality evaluation. This method's name is Serious Game Quality Assessment Method (SG-QUAM).. Second, it provides a usability and portability model aligned to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and oriented to this specific domain (i.e., serious digital games), and lastly, the quality in use while players are using the application. Moreover, 16 software engineers evaluated the solution through an experiment; the results showed good insights oriented to improve the contributions and concluded that SG-QUAM is perceived as easy to use, useful and that could be used in the future.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551903","Serious games;quality model;evaluation method;usability;portability","ISO Standards;Conferences;Serious games;Quality assessment;Usability;IEC Standards;Software tools","","2","","27","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It keeps the human metabolism up and running and can also hugely affect personal health. Despite lot's of available food options people can choose from nowadays, some still tend to prefer unhealthy food. Such malnutrition can lead to severe medical problems like the metabolic syndrome, Diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. Many people seem to lack nutritional knowledge and therefore often make poor food choices. Health promotion, which strives to empower people to take care of their health, aim to take effective countermeasures for aforementioned problems. Currently, most Austrian health promotion interventions only rely on information material and workshops and are mostly aimed at specific target groups (e.g. minors or the elderly). Therefore, the authors of this paper propose a serious game called ‚ÄúFood Pyramid Escape‚Äù which has the potential to aid health promotion in Austria and beyond. ‚ÄúFood Pyramid Escape‚Äù is a serious escape game that conveys nutritional knowledge by wrapping it into a coherent story, diverse riddles and mini-games and is targeted to a wide audience.

To achieve this, we employ the user-centered design approach in five stages. First, we elicit user preferences by conducting two concurrent focus group (FG) sessions to understand participants' current sleep habits, contributing factors, and how a persuasive mobile app (such as SleepFit) can help to improve their situation. Second, we design low-fidelity prototypes (LFP) illustrating various features of SleepFit based on our findings from the FG sessions after data analysis. Third, we conduct a user study to assess perceived persuasiveness of the features illustrated by the LFP. Our findings show that users perceived 7 features (Sleep Analysis, News Feed, Smart Alarm, Chat, Sleep Music, Notification, and Sleep Diary) as significantly persuasive for improving their sleep habits. Fourth, we design high-fidelity prototypes which reflect only the features that are perceived as significantly persuasive, based on the results of the LFP evaluation.

The mental demands of the players during various phases of the study are observed using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. Nine male division level cricketers batted against a bowling machine. The batsmen wore dry-electrode based chest-belt with a 2-lead ECG recorder to record ECG and accelerometer data during gameplay. A consolidated analysis of heart rate patterns of all batsmen was carried out to investigate the existence of a trend in heart rate variability during the preparatory and recovery phases of each shot. Results concluded the presence of a pattern that generalized heart rate variations across players with a correlation coefficient above 0.9. Comparison of the interquartile ranges of Mean RR intervals showed a drop of 9 ms in the preparation phase for bad shots following a previous good shot and a drop of 24 ms in the recovery phase for bad shots when compared to the previous shot.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551861","Electrocardiogram;Cricket;Stress;Heart Rate Variability;Wearable","Training;Wearable computers;Psychology;Electrocardiography;Physiology;Serious games;Reliability","","","","10","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to identify violent videos, with an approach capable of working in real video and synthetic video. An efficient detector of the 2D pose together with a multiple person tracker is used to extract motion features from the video sequence that will be fed directly into the proposed network. The proposed convolutional neural network is a recurrent neural network for a Spatio-temporal prediction that has convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, which enables the analysis of local motion in the video. By stacking multiple ConvLSTM layers and forming an encoding-forecasting structure, we obtain a network model for the violence detection problem and more general spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problems. The inputs for the model correspond to sequences of keypoints extracted from the skeletons present in each frame originating an output corresponding to the classification of the video. The model was trained and evaluated with an innovative dataset that contains violent videos from a popular fighting game and non-violent videos related to people's daily lives. Comparison of the results obtained with the state-of-the-art techniques revealed the promising capability of the proposed method in recognizing violent videos with 100% precision, although it is not as robust as other datasets. Conv-LSTM units are shown to be an effective means for modelling and predicting video sequences.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551853","European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); FCT - Funda√ß√£o para a Ci√™ncia e Tecnologia and FCT/MCTES(grant numbers:UIDB/05549/2020,2Ai SUMMER SCHOOL 4BI 11BII); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551853","Deep Learning;Violence detection;Conv-LSTM;Spatio-Temporal features;Keypoints","Recurrent neural networks;Tracking;Video sequences;Stacking;Virtual environments;Predictive models;Feature extraction","","","","24","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the most severe cases, it is treated with a cranial remodeling orthosis (CRO). A CRO is a customized helmet designed to constrain the growth of the infant's head, aiming to achieve head symmetry. During treatment with CROs, some complications arise due to excessive pressure in some regions, causing discomfort, redness, and skin lesions, among others. These complications often lead to the premature interruption of treatment and subsequent poor results. The monitoring of the forces inside the CRO is currently performed by sliding a plastic ruler between the head and the orthosis and assessing the amount of drag. This procedure requires experienced professionals and is subjective since there are no quantitative evaluation methods. With this work, we propose and test a proof of concept for a dedicated measurement system, that can measure the force being exerted on the infant's head in specified regions. With this new device, we expect to establish in a future work a correlation between the opinion of experienced health professionals with the measured force values, aiming to quantify a range of reference force values used in the treatment with CROs that may have future therapeutic relevance.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551910","Cranial remodeling orthosis;force sensor","Pediatrics;Force measurement;Force;Skin;Serious games;Safety;Cranial","","1","","3","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The navigation of virtual worlds allows users to explore environments and objects otherwise unavailable in a classroom setting. For example, understanding the assembly and inspection of the CANDU (CANada Deurerium Uranium) 6 reactor's fuel channels require students to rely on pictures, diagrams, videos, and computer-assisted engineering tools that lack immersion and realism. Understanding the fuel channel components in proper scale is relevant to identify sag deformations that can cause pressure tube failure to force a reactor shutdown. This is critical as fuel channel inspections need to be conducted under timed conditions to avoid harmful radiation exposure. To better understand how stress scenarios may affect user performance, physiological measurements have been used in virtual training and serious games.

Such environments place an emotional burden on the health professional, so it is important to promote the development of skills that help them to identify, manage and understand emotions. Although this ability is a useful skill in any context, for nursing students this learning has been overlooked in their training. With the help of a Serious Game, such learning can be important because it allows an active and critical approach through active experimentation. Virtual Reality (VR) can be explored to attract the attention of students, by offering a space that presents specific tasks to the educational theme, with the objective of developing new skills, as in the case of this project, emotional competencies.

This paper aims to use Health Behaviour Theories (Health Belief Model, Social Norm, and Trust) and Machine Learning to investigate or examine people's behaviours and reactions toward COVID-19. First, we extract COVID-19 comments on Twitter and use candidate keyphrases representing each health behaviour construct to label the comments. Next, we develop three machine learning models/classifiers - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Logistic Regression (LR) - to automatically classify comments into appropriate constructs. We train and evaluate the models using 10-fold cross-validation and compare their performance based on precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. Our results show that DT and SVM perform best with an overall Fl-score of up to 98% for multiclass (single label) classification, while DT outperform other classifiers with an overall Fl-score of up to 100% for multiclass-multilabel classification. Finally, we conduct thematic analysis of the comments in each construct to identify meaningful themes that represent key issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 18 volunteers participated in this study (8 with non-organic dementia) caused by substance abuse, such as alcoholism (control group) and 10 with organic dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (experimental group). We evaluated their performance using three augmented reality tasks: (1) a Knowledge Quiz activity, which is a general quiz knowledge game, (2) a Search Objects activity, which is a game that involves finding hidden images using a virtual magnifying glass and (3) an Association activity, which consists of a categorisation task. A within-subject experimental design has been used so that all participants could be exposed to distortions and activities. Results show that (1) participants, in general, were faster in completing the activities using rhythm and pitch distortions than non-distortion condition; (2) the experimental group reacted to the sound throughout the activities and, therefore, mitigating erroneous decision making; (3) despite the experimental group reacted to the distortions, the control group had better performance in the search and association activities and (4) music distortions compensated dementia related deficits, such as age, schooling and cognitive state.

In this study, we developed a multi-platform US simulator that can be used in medical education to accelerate the learning curve in probe handling and US images interpretation. The proposed solution consists of a physical portable mock-up probe and a software application that allows the real-time estimation of 2D US images of specific anatomy according to the physical probe's orientation and pressure. The portable probe has an Inertial Measurement Unit that sends the pose's information to the application via wireless communication, reslicing a template 3D volume of the anatomy according to the pose and generating the 2D image. Moreover, a silicone-based pressure sensor was attached to the probe tip to measure the force applied by the operator and to mimic the influence of the tissue's compression by the probe in the image generation process. The proposed system was evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy of the orientation estimation strategy, and linearity of the pressure sensor. The probe has a precision of 0.32¬∞, an accuracy of 3.64¬∞, and the pressure sensor has good linearity (R=0.9989).

Though smoking cessation programs for the general population are available, accessible and inclusive approaches are lacking. An encouraging new approach toward more practice-oriented and tailorable smoking cessation is virtual reality. Research indicates that virtual environments (VEs) with tobacco-related cues can elicit cue-reactivity (e.g. craving and physiological responses) and provide various new options to integrate treatment approaches. Yet, the potential to elicit cue-reactivity and the practicability of cue-reactivity measures have not been studied in vulnerable groups. This explorative study aggregated the data of twenty-three vulnerable individuals, who present themselves in three clinical settings, to validate the VEs, assess the practicability of several cue-reactivity measures (i.e. self-report questionnaires, psychophysiological data), and investigate the initial acceptance toward a prototype VE with tobacco-related cues. The results confirm the potential of the VE to elicit tobacco craving compared to baseline scores and craving in a neutral VE, as measured using one-dimensional (VAS) and multi-dimensional scales (QSU-Brief). Furthermore, the participants reported a good initial acceptance toward the VE as a potential treatment for smoking cessation. However, measuring psychophysiological responses in the clinical setting proved to be unfeasible in this research. Future studies should investigate the versatile possibilities of VEs to assess and treat vulnerable groups with tobacco dependence.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551854","Pioneers in Health Care Innovation Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551854","virtual reality;virtual environment;smoking;cue-reactivity;craving","Atmospheric measurements;Conferences;Sociology;Virtual environments;Prototypes;Particle measurements;Physiology","","1","","53","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
