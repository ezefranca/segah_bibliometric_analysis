In this context, Health Social Networks are acquiring greater force in people's lives by offering them opportunities for social networking to expose questions, experiences, besides new treatments and seek to form relationships giving or receiving emotional support. We developed a Healthcare Social Network called ""Minha Saude"", a virtual environment that facilitates contact between patients with cardiovascular problems with the goal to promote actions related to social inclusion of people involved. Through a called ""Care Plan"" available in the Social Network, we tried to motivate patients to get more interest in their own care. Daily activities, emotional states, symptoms and situations will be provided by the patient in the system through any device with internet connection. This information will be used to visualize the progress of patient's health and can be used to make medical decisions as needed. Also, we distinguish an important fact related to the Care Plan, which is the inter-relationship between patients with similar characteristics, we found it important to this action that patients can feed back their experiences and this fact can serve as motivation for them to adhere more their treatments. For this, we developed an algorithm following a Content-plus-link approach for friendship recommendation between those patients who share similar interests and thus increase the level of collaboration and communication between them. This recommendation is based on data from clinical profile, health status, interests and possible previously existing connections. The results are promising about to use of the Care Plan module and the recommendations that were accepted by the participants to create friendship.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067070","","Social network services;Vectors;Diseases;Internet;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring","","4","","26","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional methods are used generally for the rehabilitation of this disorder and studies are currently trying to rehabilitate patients through interaction with serious video games focused on health. This study proposes a combination of the two methods to find improvements in the flexion angle of shoulder affected by upper motor neurone lesion in patients of the “Clinica de Dolor del Eje Cafetero”. Methodology - 6 patients (3 patients with sequels of stroke, 1 patient with sequels of TBI and 2 patients with sequels of cerebral palsy) were taken into consideration. All patients suffered monoparesia in upper limb. Each patient had 7 sessions of rehabilitation. Each session of rehabilitation lasted for 30 minutes of assisted therapy and another 30 minutes with therapies of VR, where the movements of flexion of the shoulder affected through the Kinect sensor were recorded while the patient interacted with the video game. A biomechanical analysis with the Bio-Cirac software developed to load data from MoCap and show angle graphs was performed. Results - the patient who achieved the best results showed 21.0 % of improvement in the angle of flexion of the affected shoulder and improvement in muscular endurance and control of their affected limb. Conclusion - VR and serious video games specifically designed for particular pathologies are potentially useful technologies that can be combined with conventional methods to improve the angle of amplitude of flexion of the shoulder affected in patients with sequels of upper motor neurone lesion. In addition VR offers immersive experiences favorable for dissipation of pain, fatigue, setting goals and enjoyment of the activity.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067072","pyramidal syndrome;Kinect;Rehabilitation;Exergame;Serious Game","Games;Medical treatment;Lesions;Neurons;Virtual reality;Pain;Muscles","","1","","19","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The subjects were 33 patients with hemiplegia after stroke (aged 33-81 years), who played the CCAG on 8 separate occasions over a 12 week period; 19 in the chronic phase after stroke, with stable function; 14 in the acute phase during recovery of function. A convergent construct validation process was used by correlating the scores of the CCAG with a validated, clinically assessed reference, the Chedoke Arm and Hand Assessment Inventory (CAHAI). Cross- sectional validity was demonstrated using the between-subjects correlation coefficient (r = .998, p-value <; .001); longitudinal validity by the within-subjects correlation coefficient (overall, r = .54, p-value <; .001; chronic, r = .33, p-value <; .001; acute, r = .63, p - value <; .001). There was no difference between the CCAG and CAHAI in the classification of pa- tients to acute and chronic groups (comparing ROC curves, p - value = .50), demonstrating similar sensitivity to change. This is the first time a serious game can achieve automatic in- game assessment to a clinical standard, solely using low cost, commodity hardware and professionally written action video games and demonstrates the potential for remote monitoring of patients during home based rehabilitation programs.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067073","eHealth;upper-limb functional ability;validity;sensitivity to change;stroke;video games;ROC analysiseHealth;upperlimb functional ability;validity;sensitivity to change;stroke;video games;ROC analysis","Games;Sensitivity;Correlation;Standards;Aging;Remote monitoring;Medical treatment","","7","","19","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been well established that lack of proper estimation of preschool children's activity levels may be one of the main causes for childhood obesity. Childhood obesity has several long term health effects ranging from cardio-vascular disease to type II diabetes and obese preschool children are at risk for later life. We have developed an application that caters to both the parent and the child and uses a virtual garden as a fledgling ecosystem controlled both by the parent and the child. By using a low-cost activity monitoring device and combining the data collected from the device with the estimation inputs from the parent the ecosystem manifests into real life-like visualizations that are updated on a daily basis. The goal of the design is to promote a two way intervention: 1)provide parents with a tool to daily estimate and monitor their child's activity levels and 2)motivate the child to achieve built in goals and keep the ecosystem lively and flourishing. We believe that our design will lead to improved outcomes in physical activity levels as well as long term retention and reuse by the parents. In this paper we are providing the design of the system and in future plan to present the results of a pilot trial.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067075","","Pediatrics;Games;Obesity;Ecosystems;Computers;Estimation;Meteorology","","7","","50","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LSs have undeniable advantages, such as small patient incisions, reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery. On the other hand, restricted vision of the anatomical target, difficult handling of the surgical instruments, restricted mobility inside the human body, need of dexterity to hand-eye coordination and inadequate and non-ergonomic surgical instruments may restrict LS only to more specialized surgeons. To overcome the referred limitations, this work presents a new robotic surgical handheld system - the EndoRobot. The EndoRobot was designed to be used in clinical practice or even as a surgical simulator. It integrates an electromechanical system with 3 degrees of freedom. Each degree can be manipulated independently and combined with different levels of sensitivity allowing fast and slow movements. As other features, the EndoRobot has battery power or external power supply, enables the use of bipolar radiofrequency to prevent bleeding while cutting and allows plug-and-play of the laparoscopic forceps for rapid exchange. As a surgical simulator, the system was also instrumented to measure and transmit, in real time, its position and orientation for a training software able to monitor and assist the trainee's surgical movements.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067079","minimal invasive surgery;robotic surgical handheld system;surgical training;robotic surgery","Instruments;Grippers;Robots;Gears;Minimally invasive surgery;Training","","2","4","20","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes Ilera-Ayie (from Yoruba language, Land of Health), a virtual world to support 3D serious games for health education and promotion, focused on the communitary health agents and the young population of rural settlements at Brazil's northeastern countryside. Non-functional requirements elicitation was performed by using participatory workshops involving participants of two rural settlements at the Northern Forest region of the State of Pernambuco, northeast of Brazil. Taking into account Popular Education and Participatory Design as theoretical backgrounds, design elements of the virtual world were defined using participatory workshops, considering identity aspects of communities, such as the local vegetation, animals, houses, historic buildings of the Brazil's Empire age of slavery, and musical elements, trying to make a link between local and universal cultural elements.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067084","","Education;Games;Communities;Conferences;Cultural differences;Context;Three-dimensional displays","","4","","35","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current solutions consist mostly of motion tracking gloves with embedded resistive bend sensors that most often suffer from signal drift, sensor saturation, sensor displacement and complex calibration procedures. More advanced solutions provide better tracking stability, but at the expense of a higher cost. The proposed solution aims to provide the required precision, stability and feasibility through the combination of eleven inertial measurements units (IMUs). Each unit captures the spatial orientation of the attached body. To fully capture the hand movement, each finger encompasses two units (at the proximal and distal phalanges), plus one unit at the back of the hand. The proposed glove was validated in two distinct steps: (a) evaluation of the sensors' accuracy and stability over time; (b) evaluation of the bending trajectories during usual finger flexion tasks based on the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results revealed that the glove was sensitive mainly to magnetic field distortions and sensors tuning. The inclusion of a hard and soft iron correction algorithm and accelerometer and gyro drift and temperature compensation methods provided increased stability and precision. Finger trajectories evaluation yielded high ICC values with an overall reliability within application's satisfying limits. The developed low cost system provides a straightforward calibration and usability, qualifying the device for hand and finger tracking in healthcare and animation industries.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067086","motion tracking glove;finger flexion;inertial measurement unit;hand rehabilitation","Thumb;Gyroscopes;Magnetometers;Temperature sensors;Joints","","24","1","12","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not clear whether the two approaches lead to similar results or whether focusing on performance may lead to suboptimal enjoyment. This is relevant since, in addition to being performance-oriented, serious games and learning environments also need to be enjoyable to be effective. To address this issue, we evaluated two kinds of difficulty adaptation in a simple memory training game: one adaptation based solely on difficulty-performance matching and the other based solely on providing a high degree of control/choice. Our results suggest that neither approach is optimal: players enjoyed themselves the most in the control/choice mode, but performed the best in the difficulty-performance matching mode. Player behavior in the game suggests that a trade-off between maximizing performance and maximizing enjoyment could be achieved by a combination of the two approaches. However, long-term studies would be required to determine whether such a combination could indeed be effective.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067088","","Games;Clamps;Training;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Materials","","14","","43","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model compares two different learning situations, one using Serious Games, the other one using conventional ways of learning. Because the application of freshly learned knowledge is fundamental for any change of behavior (e.g. in business processes) the model can be applied to any cogitable process change. The CTM will be combined with the Serious Game Design Assessment Framework (SGDAF) as stressed by the learning theorists Konstantin Mitgutsch and Narda Alvarado [4]. By testing the models' applicability in terms of the CTM itself as well as of the combination with the SGDAF, it is not only elaborated whether the examined Serious Games (SGs) are an economically valuable alternative to classical transformation processes. Also, an answer will be given to the question how the (first six, later eight) design components should be rated and whether the melted model is complete as it stands. The analysis raises the question, whether the CTM and the SGDAF respect the inevitable influencing factors like for example personality for whether they need adaptation and if so, which. Three healthcare SGs will be evaluated in order to indicatively calculate whether the single-step classical way of change management (A) is more effective than the sum of the three steps (B1, B2, B3) taken in the SG detour. The same will be done with the SGDAF. Finally, it will be reflected upon the question whether the outcome, an eight-elements-chart, is universally valid, meaning whether it might serve as an omniuseful tool for the assessment of any SG.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067089","Comparative Transformation Model (CTM);process change management;learning;Serious Games;transformation;Serious Game Design Assessment Framework (SGDAF);SAPS II;EVAcuation;VR2Smile","Training;Games;Three-dimensional displays;Hospitals;Organizations","","1","","10","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we present a series of IDS educational games developed with the aim of promoting responsible antibiotic use and hygiene part of the edugames4all project. Despite commercial success and market popularity of IDS games one of the major challenges we encountered when the games were distributed to schools for evaluation was that many children never played a similar game before and found the concept challenging. As a result, some of the children enjoyed the game while others were frustrated and gave up at a certain point. Although the phenomenon is not new, and it present even in commercial games, we proposed a new approach to ensure that all children understand the message delivered and at the same time, they enjoy playing the game. This paper proposes the introduction of a training mission that teaches children in a game like environment the basic concepts necessary to progress through the game. The training mission was evaluated in experimental settings with two groups of children, one playing the training mission before playing the game and another one who did not. The results showed that there is no statistically significant difference in terms of usability between the two groups, however the group that did not play the training mission found the game more “awkward” to play, and the difference between the groups in this case was statistically significant.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067091","serious games;games for health;games for hildren;interactive digital storytelling;tutorial;educational games","Games;Training;Usability;Pediatrics;Tutorials;Antibiotics","","13","","33","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results in this paper demonstrate significant advances in the ability to simulate affective NPC agent in games toward modifying the way in which players analyze a current NPC and mainly at the level of pleasure dueling it.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067101","affective computing;NPC;digital games;artificial intelligence","Games;Computer architecture;Affective computing;Artificial intelligence;Computers;Testing;Sociology","","","","21","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually people try to deal with these ruminative thoughts by trying to avoid thinking, which paradoxically makes the thoughts even more intense. Several researchers proposed that ruminative thoughts are central in anxiety and depressive disorders and that the treatment of rumination is also pivotal in the treatment of these disorders. This study is a first attempt to construct a game that trains players in shifting the attention from ruminative thoughts to problem-solving tasks, illustrating the use of the game. We expect that training such an ability will reduce the intensity of that thoughts. It is our expectation that the continuous use of games with these kind of features will reduce the intensity of ruminative thoughts, improving the wellbeing and reducing the psychological suffering of players.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067104","Ruminative Thoughts;Serious Game;Disturbing Thoughts","Games;Psychology;Color;Training;Medical treatment;Presses;Skin","","3","","18","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper the novel virtual game scenario generation process for this serious game is presented. The goal of the process is to allow non-technical users to model virtual scenarios. After writing the scenarios, the scenarios can be modelled in ATTAC-L and afterwards translated in computer interpretable XML. This XML is then used to automatically build the scenario within the game engine so that it can be played. This paper details the ATTAC-L scenario generation and how it is translated to an in game scenario. Thanks to the presented tools and methods, it is possible to transform a written scenario into an in game virtual game scenario.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067106","","Games;XML;Concurrent computing;Natural languages;Computers;Syntactics;Generators","","13","","7","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regardless financial or social status, age and profession, a person exposed to stress may develop health problems that can interfere with work and his quality of life. Thus, due to absenteeism and reduced productivity, companies and governments lose money when people are stressed. In this scenario, it is important to use strategies to combat such drawback. Recovery and Coping are examples of such strategies. Recovery refers to activities that allow individuals to regain consumed energy after work, stress or strain. The experience of Recovery is achieved by activities that offer: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery experience and control. Coping refers to actions and strategies applied by an individual to react to stress and problem situations. Coping with stress can be basically achieved, in two ways: problem-focused or emotion-focused. Literature shows that strategies that take into account the needs of individual workers have a greater chance of success. On the other hand, computer games offer players some experiences like: relaxation, sense of control, challenges, learning opportunities and immersion. These characteristics can contribute to the control process of stress. The objective of this paper is to propose a new methodology for combating stress, focused on emotion. In so doing, we use Serious Games associated to Flow theory and Virtual/Augmented Reality techniques, considering particular patient needs.","","978-1-4799-4823-9","10.1109/SeGAH.2014.7067107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067107","Coping stress;Recovery;Serious games;Virtual and augmented reality","Stress;Games;Psychology;Computers;Augmented reality;Strain;Context","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
