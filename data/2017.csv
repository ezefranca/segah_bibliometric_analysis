This approach does not factor in the impact of the medium of the message. A virtual, 360-degree environment (Messaging360) was developed that online participants can explore and be exposed to messages in a variety of different social and physical contexts: through advertising in a newspaper, labels on products and from a small child and a doctor avatar. The platform allows for large numbers of participants to be tested in a way that models real-life contexts for the messages and so may represent a more effective way of assessing their impact in delivering the health information. Analysis revealed a significant difference in the time spent attending to messages delivered by different people or objects in the simulation. Participants also attended to the message delivered by the doctor avatar longer than the child avatar, which was further affected by the order in which they were encountered. There was also a significant association between age and time spent in the simulation. It was concluded that the Messaging360 platform models real-life contexts closely enough to provoke detectable differences in responses from participants by varying the context in which the message is being delivered. The program and the warning statements can be manipulated to test a broad range of hypotheses in future studies.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939255","Alcohol;E-Technology;Gamification;Health","Medical services;Alcoholic beverages;Biomedical imaging;Navigation;Cameras;Analysis of variance","","","","22","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, assessment of the trainees' response to these training activities has either been limited to various pre and post training assessment metrics or collected in parallel during experiments and analysed after collection rather than in real-time. New Big Data approaches have the potential to provide real-time analytics. We have created a Big Data analytics platform, Athena, that in real-time acquires data from a first person shooter military combat simulation game, ArmA 3, as well as the data ArmA 3 sends to the muscle stimulation component of a multisensory garment, ARAIG that provides on the body feedback to the wearer for communications, weapon fire and being hit and integrates that data with physiological response data such as heart rate, breathing behaviour and blood oxygen saturation.

To the extent that intelligent assistive technologies can help, there seems to be value in comforting fabric artifacts enhanced by electronic games and activities designed to support, engage and entertain people with dementia. Local cottage industries which now support the creation of textile crafts should be empowered to scale up to meet the growing demand for such products. New design concepts are required to accomplish this in the face of rising costs and limited resources. This paper proposes a four-step design process that meets this need, and provides practical suggestions about how it could be applied in this context.

The upper limb module primarily focuses on the rehabilitation of the upper body extremities of stroke survivors. An experimental study is designed to test the usability of the upper limb module. Various metrics including the optimal distance between the 3D depth sensor device and the survivor, the optimal position of the 3D depth sensor with respect to the survivor, and the response time of the gestures made by the survivors based on their distance to the sensor are evaluated. At the end of the experiments, the optimal distance and optimal position for the survivors to utilise the upper limb module is determined.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939258","game;Neuromender;stroke;rehabilitation;upper limb","Australia;Robot sensing systems;Performance evaluation;Irrigation;Motion measurement;Servers","","4","","30","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can result in both physical and cognitive deficits in the survivor. Without regular rehabilitation, a survivor will reach a chronic condition resulting in a huge burden. Rehabilitation is expansive, and a major issue is access as care givers are needed to take survivors to rehabilitation centres. This paper presents Neuromender::FlexiBrains, a novel game-based rehabilitation system with autonomous adjustment capabilities that can be used in a stroke survivor's home. The system was developed in collaboration with clinicians, neuroscientists and stroke survivors. Stroke clinicians can customise their rehabilitation to cater for each stroke survivor's deficits. The system enables clinicians to remotely monitor and track their clients' progress. Rehabilitation regimes can also be adjusted remotely. The system enables prescribed monitored rehabilitation to be carried out, and it permits clinicians to take care of more survivors without sacrificing the quality of care.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939259","cognitive;FlexiBrains;Neuromender;rehabilitation;serious game;stroke","Australia;Lead;Databases;Artificial neural networks","","","","19","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, home-based rehabilitation games require a technique for automatic difficulty adjustment. This paper proposes a personalized difficulty adjustment technique for a rehabilitation game that automatically regulates difficulty settings based on a patient's skills in real-time. To this end, ideas from reinforcement learning are used to dynamically adjust the difficulty of a game. We show that difficulty adjustment is a multiple-objective problem, in which some objectives might be evaluated at different periods. To address this problem, we propose and use Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning (MPRL) that makes it possible to evaluate different objectives of difficulty adjustment in separate periods. The results of experiments show that MPRL outperforms traditional Multiple-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) in terms of user satisfaction parameters as well as improving the movement skills of patients.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939260","","Biological cells;Silicon","","23","","30","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patients who could access and afford to consult physiotherapists, at times lack motivation and flexibility in exercise timings. Unadjustable appointments and time spent in travelling to such facilities are barriers to a regular exercise regime. The aim of this project was to design an interactive full body exercise experience platform while addressing issues such as accessibility, affordability and motivation issues for patients affected with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Our project had two dimensions: An exercise regime with a virtual instructor and games based on exercises. These methods were tested with patients and evaluated qualitatively.

New technologies such as robotic devices and serious games are increasingly being developed to improve post-stroke rehabilitation. The aim of the present project was to develop a ROBiGAME serious game to simultaneously improve motor and cognitive deficits (in particular hemiparesis and hemineglect). In this context, the difficulty level of the game was adapted to each patient's performance, and this individualized adaptation was addressed as the main challenge of the game development. The game was implemented on the REAplan end-effector rehabilitation robot, which was used in continuous interaction with the game. A preliminary feasibility study of a target pointing game was run in order to validate the game features and parameters. Results showed that the game was perceived as enjoyable, and that patients reported a desire to play the game again. Most of the targets included in the game design were realistic, and they were well perceived by the patients. Results also suggested that the cognitive help strategy could include one visual prompting cue, possibly combined with an auditory cue. It was observed that the motor assistance provided by the robot was well adapted for each patient's impairments, but the study results led to a suggestion that the triggering conditions should be reviewed. Patients and therapists reported the desire to receive more feedback on the patient's performances. Nevertheless, more patients and therapists are needed to play the game in order to give further and more comprehensive feedback that will allow for improvements of the serious game. Future steps also include the validation of the motivation assessment module that is currently under development.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939262","serious game;robotic assisted-rehabilitation;stroke;hemineglect;hemiparesis;upper limb;motivation","Robots;Trajectory;Regulators;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","22","","26","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and abilities and applying “Rebel Design” for games.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939263","computational thinking (CT);rebel design;game;problem solving;connected;digital ecosystem;framework","Games;Problem-solving;Tools;Handheld computers","","","","24","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such benefits could be exploited to improve teaching of surgical hand preparation (SHP), a practice crucial in preventing post-surgical infection. This study hypothesises that the utilisation of VR technology to demonstrate SHP technique will produce superior skill acquisition and longer skill retention than the standard practice of video demonstration. 40 healthcare students unfamiliar with SHP were recruited from a tertiary university and randomised into two groups. The control group (n=21) viewed a video demonstration of SHP while the VR group (n=19) viewed a VR demonstration of the same technique. Participants were assessed immediately after demonstration (acquisition score), and again one week later (retention score), using a 20-point assessment scale. Scores were compared between the groups. Groups were equal in age, prior education, handedness and gender distribution. Neither skill acquisition (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.84; p = 0.57) nor retention (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.74; p = 0.52) differed significantly between groups however a non-significant trend toward better performance in the VR group was observed. Parallel scoring of 35% of participants showed very high inter-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.92). Utilisation of VR technology did not demonstrate a perceivable acquisition or retention benefit in the teaching of SHP. Future studies could investigate the value of more immersive features including 360-degree point of view or haptic feedback which were not features of the technology used in the present study.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939269","Surgical Hand Preparation;Virtual Reality;Training","Surgery;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Pollution measurement;Standards;Muscles","","7","","21","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem can be found across all age groups. In order to raise awareness on that matter and educate about healthy nutrition the authors designed a serious game which was entitled “NutritionRush” together with a nutritionist. It offers a nutrition library to look up nutrition details regarding nutrients, nutritional values, daily energy intake and encourages users to actively employ their knowledge while trying to accomplish specific missions during the game part. The authors also evaluated the initial prototype of NutritionRush with 14 participants in terms of gameplay satisfaction, user experience, quality of nutritional content and the potential to educate or foster healthy eating behaviors.

We used a Pac-Man style game enhanced with Respiratory Biofeedback, Pac-Man Zen, to compare 1) breathing control during play, 2) the carry-over of said control into a subsequent stressful task and 3) cognitive improvement in a subsequent stressful task against a non-biofeedback version of the game. Results showed that one-time training with the biofeedback version of the game was not only more effective, but also led to improved performance in a later stressful task, both in terms of lowered breathing and improved test scores, compared to the non-biofeedback version. The result is important because it suggests that stimulating, casual biofeedback games can be effective at teaching breathing control, and thus arousal regulation, in a stressful setting.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939272","biofeedback;mobile game;stress regulation;game-based learning;respiratory control","Continuous wavelet transforms;Games;Medical treatment;Color;TV","","8","","28","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early detection of tumors by breast exams and procedures can help to reduce these numbers. More medical practice is required. Professional training for medical procedures in real environments is costly and risky both for the student and the patient. A way to reduce costs and risks of training is by the use of a virtual simulator. An environment closer to the real world in medical simulations can provide a better quality experience of to the trainee. The use of haptic devices can emulate tactile sensations and feedback forces that correspond to body structures and density of tissues. The used device has six degrees of freedom (DOF): movement on three axes (x, y, and z), rotations, and horizontal and vertical inclinations. This work presents a virtual environment for breast exams practice and sentinel nodes detection procedures that employ the use of a haptic device and a gamified interface for feedbacks. The objective is to improve early breast cancer diagnosis chances. A model for tissue deformation calculations on tridimensional patient body mesh is proposed, to add visual realism to the interactions in the virtual environment. Needle depth and its tridimensional position data are updated at real-time on needle insertion. Tumor nodes size and position are dynamically generated upon each simulation, increasing training possibilities for the student. The gamification strategy improves the practice on environment, with elements to engage the player on activity. User progress is tracked by subdivision of breast exams and procedures into smaller challenges, for better performance evaluation on the virtual environment. A gamified interface, with player score and achievements mapping is included. These gamification features have not been employed on breast simulators from previously investigated works.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939273","Breast Palpation;Medical Procedure;Needle Insertion;Gamification;Training;Sentinel Node Detection","Breast;Haptic interfaces;Needles;Medical diagnostic imaging;Virtual environments;Training;Visualization","","3","","21","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper primarily focuses upon - taking objective measures of the precision of control a player experiences as the interface for a game is changed as a consequence of incorporating an exertion based control scheme. Four standard tests used in the psychology literature have been employed to understand the performance differences in terms of detection and speed of response, combined with precise `pixel accurate' motion and tracking of objects.

Considering that some observations suggest that the first step in targeting stress should be in identifying the stressors that negatively affect the person. Moreover, since serious games have been proved effective for the transfer of knowledge, our work aims at designing a serious game that may help people at identifying stressors of the workplace. As a first step, we report the main elements required for such a game. For this, we use two frameworks that allow us to target the two main aspects of this serious game.

This preliminary study aimed to determine if the principle of distraction, using a relaxing Virtual Reality (VR) immersion, would reduce preoperative anxiety in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. Sixty patients were randomised into three groups (Standard care group, Virtual Reality group and iPad group). Anxiety scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), heart rate and blood pressure were measured pre and post intervention. The Standard care group received no intervention. The iPad group watched a video slideshow of beaches around the world and the VR group experienced a virtual beach immersion. Guided relaxation audio content (via headphones) was replicated across VR and iPad groups. Planned comparisons showed a significant difference between the average GSR measures at Time 1 and Time 2 between the Standard group and VR group. GSR measures for the Standard care group increased by 54 per cent from time 1 to time 2 and the VR and iPad groups reduced slightly, demonstrating an ameliorating effect on anxiety levels. A marginal difference between the Standard care group and VR group in anxiety change scores was reported. Whilst the VR condition reduced anxiety more than Standard care in both GSR and Anxiety change score measures, it provided no significant advantage over iPad condition. In conclusion, distraction using VR and iPad temporarily reduces self-reported anxiety levels and GSR measures compared to standard care in patients prior to knee arthroscopy. Further study is required to determine how long-lasting these benefits are in a clinical setting. The continuing advancements in VR technology, including immersion quality, present an opportunity to investigate the application of VR as a ‘digital pre-med’.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939282","Preoperative anxiety;virtual reality;distraction","Heart;Headphones;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Standards","","17","","69","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technology has a great potential in wearable, comfortable, and wireless moisture sensing systems, although it is not originally used for sensing purposes. In our study, the tag antenna outlines are embroidered on a fabric substrate, the tag ICs are attached by embroidery or with conductive glue, and the tag performance as a moisture sensor is evaluated by wireless measurements. All tags attained peak read ranges of about 7-8 meters, which is well enough for wireless moisture sensors. The effects of moisture on the tag response were noticeable through a frequency range of 900-980 MHz and the tag performance was excellent also when wet. Thus, the achieved results indicate high potential of passive UHF RFID textile tags in moisture sensing and embroidery as a textile tag antenna and antenna-IC interconnection fabrication method.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939286","embroidery;fabric antennas;moisture;passive sensing;UHF RFID;wearable technology;welfare technology","Radiofrequency identification;Antennas;Semiconductor device measurement;Integrated circuits;Antenna measurements;Weight measurement;Substrates","","17","","14","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Other than for step detection, human activity classification is normally undertaken by calculating features from a fixed interval length of sensor data and comparing them to values expected from a range of activities. It was observed that many human activities, especially vigorous activities, are cyclic. This paper tested the hypothesis that, if features are calculated over an integer number of cycles of a cyclic activity, more accurate activity classifications will be achieved. An algorithm was developed that determines whether an activity is cyclic and if so, identifies the cycles and calculates the feature set over an integer multiple of cycles. If the activity is determined to be non-cyclic, the features are calculated over a fixed time window. The hypothesis that more accurate activity classifications will be achieved was confirmed with a pairwise t-test at the 99% significance level. Knowledge that a cyclic activity is taking place is already informative and can enable generation of features from individual cycles. One of these, cycle length, was added to the feature set which improved recognition rates for activities where the cycle length varied greatly from other activities. For example, brushing teeth improved from 39% with a fixed window to 54% for an adaptive window and 74% for an adaptive window with cycle length. An overall improvement in activity classification success rate was found for this adaptive windowing method compared to a fixed window approach with overall success rates of 54% for a fixed window, 62% for an adaptive window and 64% for an adaptive window with the additional feature.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939289","activity classification;adaptive windowing;accelerometer;cyclic activities","Feature extraction;Correlation;Data mining;Testing","","5","","18","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Preservation of parathyroid glands (PGs) and treatment of postoperative hypocalcemia are key factors. The aim of this review is to evaluate the relevant literature and provide the clinician guidance for preservation of PGs and the formulation of individualized therapeutic strategies for patients with postoperative hypocalcemia. Methods: This was a review of preservation of PGs in thyroidectomy procedures and treatment strategies for postoperative hypocalcemia. Results: In-depth knowledge of the anatomy of PGs along with relations and an adequate preoperative assessment are the cornerstone for surgeons performing safe thyroid parathyroid surgeries. The “capsular dissection” of the thyroid lobe is the key technique to protect PGs and their supply blood vessels; the intraoperative parathyroid autotransplantation if the occasion should arise is an effective method to prevent definitive hypoparathyroidism. The patients after thyroidectomy are given monitoring of the serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH); the early combinational supplement treatment of calcium and calcitriol effectively prevent postoperative hypocalcemia. Conclusion: To master the anatomic regularity of PGs, intraoperative in-situ conservation and autotransplantation of PGs, and postoperative individualized therapeutic strategies of hypoparathyroidism are effective methods to avoid hypocalcemia in thyroid surgery.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939291","Parathyroid;Thyroid;Hypocalcemia;Hypoparathyroidism;Thyroidectomy","Fluorescence;Visualization;Probes;Needles;Ligaments;Physiology","","","","48","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dengue virus is transmitted mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also a vector of other diseases such as zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever. Its transmission dynamics is complex, involving several actors, factors and processes. Acting against vectors is still an important strategy, mainly due to limitations in efficacy and accessibility of vaccines. We believe that including and awareness of population is an important factor to address the problem. This project aims to design and develop a serious game to support actions and strategies based on prevention and epidemiological surveillance. In order to raise awareness about vector ecology and disease transmission dynamics, the game design presents information and seeks to encourage behavior changes in a playful environment. Moreover, gamification strategies are being used to stimulate concrete actions in real world. A mix of 2D-based game, augmented reality, virtual reality and the real world itself, will provide the proper environment to offer fun with the purpose of helping to deal with this complex problem.

In most situations, this is caused by an incorrect posture, which causes changes in the spine structure. This paper proposes an instrumented vest for postural reeducation to address this issue. The vest has a set of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors strategically placed to provide an accurate characterization of the spine profile. The sensor readings are classified by a central processing unit. In case of an incorrect posture, users are alerted by an audio signal and through vibration. The wearable system works in stand-alone mode, but can also communicate with external systems through an API. Two applications were developed to communicate with the device through this API, one intended to run on a desktop computer and the other one for Android devices. These applications monitor spine profiles in real time and notify the user of incorrect postures, among other functionalities. The device prototype and the applications have been tested by 10 individuals in two different settings, first without any kind of feedback and then with feedback enabled. The tests demonstrate the usability, accuracy and robustness of the system, proving its high level of reliability in classifying postures and effectiveness for postural reeducation. In the future, the system is expected to be used as a platform for a serious game, to promote posture reeducation in a real world scenario.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939300","Postural Reeducation;Spine;Wearable device;IMU;Classifier","Instruments;Personnel;Object recognition;Medical services;Cameras;Tracking;Skin","","5","","48","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the utilization of these applications in the developing countries is very low due to low literacy in English and ICT. The aim of the study is to identify basic design considerations for making games more accessible, utilizable and stimulating for people with Alzheimer's disease who lack IT literacy skills as well as English knowledge. This research utilizes qualitative data in the research design which comprised of two stages: Scoping stage and Prototype development stage. Scoping stage consisted of an observation conducted with a sample of 6 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease giving a prevailing serious game to identify the issues in them. Participatory design was followed in the Prototype development stage, conducted with a sample of 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease which consisted of 2 observations: one during the developing stage and the other after the development.

Some of our findings were games are more accurate when developed based on MOCA test and relating on their day to day lives, simple and easy games with short duration, using real images in the games, bigger buttons with more space between them, instructions in their native language etc. The findings suggest that developing serious games following these design considerations would make these games more accessible, utilizable and stimulating for people with Alzheimer's disease who lack English knowledge and IT literacy skills, especially in Sri Lankan context.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939301","Serious games;Design considerations;Alzheimer's disease;Developing Nations;Cognitive Stimulation Therapy","Games;Prototypes","","11","","23","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
