"A Rewarding Framework for Multiplayer Serious Games based on Competitive Reinforcement","Y. A. Sekhavat","Faculty of Multimedia, Tabriz Islamic Art University, Tabriz, Iran",2019 IEEE 7th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH),"28 Oct 2019","2019","","","1","8","To promote a desired behavior in serious games, the rewarding mechanism is an important part of game design that can directly affect the game experience. In single player serious games, the rewarding system is generally performed by negative reinforcement (removing barriers for positive behaviors and creating barriers for negative behaviors) or positive reinforcement (providing facilities to progress in the game for positive behavior). Although research has shown the advantages of positive reinforcement compared to negative reinforcement, this issue is not well studied for multiplayer serious games. To address this problem, we propose a new rewarding framework, which is called competitive reinforcement rewarding. In this framework, a positive behavior of a player results in difficult conditions for other players competing in the game, while a negative behavior of a player facilitates the scoring process of opponents. We have applied this concept on a attention training game based on a multiplayer adversarial car racing game. We performed a comprehensive user study to evaluate the attention level, emotions and attitudes of players in competitive reinforcement versus positive/negative reinforcement versions. Our findings suggest that the competitive reinforcement rewarding framework provides more encouragement for players to increase and maintain their attention level than positive and negative reinforcement rewarding. We also showed that this rewarding framework can affect the emotional state and the behavior of players that can consequently improve their playing experience.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882473","Serious Games;Rewarding;Competition;Competitive Reinforcement","Games;Measurement;Training;Automobiles;Reinforcement learning;Deep learning;Acceleration","","2","","23","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exergaming, a form of active video gaming, can provide an alternative upper body exercise that is dose-potent (moderate-vigorous intensity). Objective: This cross-sectional study sought to assess Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) for three types of exercise, Move Boxing (MB), Move Kayaking (MK) and ACE, when conducted within similar heart rate (HR) training zones. Methods: Biomechanical descriptions, RPE and PACES scores were taken for each session. Analyses of variance with Hedge's g were used for significant differences and effect sizes in HR, RPE and PACES scores between the three types of exercises and injury category. Results: The average HR was not different (p=0.489) between exercises (ACE: 110±15, MB: 114±19; MK: 115±17). Tetraplegia (ACE: 95±6, MB: 100±8, MK: 97±12) had lower (p=0.005) average HR than paraplegia (ACE: 117±12, MB: 121±18, MK: 123±13) but when normalised to peak HR was not different (p=0.098). The RPE and PACES were significantly different (p=0.022) between the three types of exercises. ACE produced a lower RPE than both exergames (p=0.002) while Move Boxing was more enjoyable than both ACE (p=0.001) and Move Kayaking (p=0.003). Conclusion: All three exercises achieved vigorous intensity (70-80% of peak HR) for individuals with tetraplegia and paraplegia. Move Boxing was found to be difficult but more enjoyable than conventional ACE when done within similar HR training intensities.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882460","Video games;Boxing;Kayaking;Perceived Exertion;Ergometry;Heart Rate","Heart rate;Training;Biomechanics;Injuries;Games;Legged locomotion;Biomedical monitoring","","3","","41","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although it is affecting more older people, stroke within younger people is on the rise and is a big problem for the affected. They have to undergo rehabilitation to hopefully regain lost abilities, which poses a time consuming and monotonous process. This needs to be done together with a therapist and contains a lot of different exercises for different parts of the body. This is where serious gaming emerged within the last few years to support this process by including gaming aspects to increase motivation and compliance of the patients. But there are a lot of different serious games available for supporting stroke patients and normally these games need additional devices for controlling the game. Therefore, the authors propose a new and easy to use solution of a serious game, which is just using the integrated sensors of a mobile device. This game was created together with a therapist with feedback from 13 of his patients throughout an user centred design process. It poses a novel approach with easy to understand levels for movement, gesture and touch exercises, which contain different difficulty levels to fit the individual needs of the patients.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882447","stroke;rehabilitation;mHealth;serious game;gamification","Games;Stroke (medical condition);Sensors;Prototypes;Glass;Thumb;Mobile handsets","","12","","23","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile games on a smartphone can contribute to a long-term motivation to continue home training with the necessary intensity. The patients control the game with their muscle signals, exactly how they would control their actual prosthesis. In this study, we examined the usability of the gaming system, its functionality and subjective quality. It was rated highly in all aspects by both experimental groups, with the patient group consistently rating higher than the able-bodied group. Although highly rated, results showed detailed potential for improvement regarding the aesthetics of the app and provided information in-app. The mobile training app not only provides feedback on the correct execution of muscle activation, but also maintains the patient's motivation through various feedback elements. In a clinical pilot study, three upper limb amputees trained their neuromuscular control over the course of four weeks while playing the game and clinical parameters important for prosthetic control have been evaluated pre and post intervention.

The exergame was designed to elicit specific body movements during gameplay involving weight-shift (transfer of body weight from one foot to the other), which is considered beneficial for training balance. The body movements observed during gameplay were analyzed using a modified Labanotation. The study was conducted with twelve able-bodied adults. All users played the exergame successfully, but contrary to our expectations, only 23% of the observed player movements corresponded to the specific body movements the exergame intended to elicit. Despite the low number of intended movements, 49% of the observed movements involved weight-shift. The exergame was therefore appropriate for balance training, although users moved differently than what we had designed for. Regarding balance-training exergames, our findings suggest that designers need worry less about “puppeteering” able-bodied players with a strict choreography to elicit specific body movements. Instead we recommend that designers embrace a less rigid design approach, where the goal is to elicit desired movement characteristics (e.g., weight-shift) through a more open and playful behavior.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882452","Balance training;Body-based interaction;Design;Exergames;Movement characteristics;Weight-shift","Games;Solar system;Training;Guidelines;Trajectory;Computer science;Neuroscience","","1","","33","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When considering the aging population, falls and fall-related injuries pose a major challenge, affecting continued ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), independence, and quality of life. With the emergence of smart furniture technologies, opportunities arise within the health and rehabilitation sector. Amalgamating technology with game orientated exercise (exergames) facilitates the delivery of entertaining, complimentary tools in the provision of preventative and rehabilitative intervention. The aim of this paper is to study the potential of an exergame for seniors' physical activation. In this study, a prototype physiotherapeutic exergames based on a smart chair was developed in collaboration with physiotherapists and game developers. User experiences were then investigated through a demo event to investigate the motivation, interest, social interaction, and suitability of the game concept for self-initiated physical training. User experience data was gathered based on researchers' observations and a questionnaire. This data was collected from users (older adults) and facilitators (social and health care professionals and students). The results indicate the game and the chair controller to be suitable and accepted by elderly as a mean of self-activation and physical training. The game concept also showed potential in enhancing social interaction in a group-setting. Although the responses from the participants show some variation, generally the results indicate feeling of usefulness and need for exergames. More research is required to investigate the long-term effects of the games on user experiences, physical/social effects, and potential decrease of fall risk.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882482","physical ability;fall-prevention;older adults;recreation;self-managed rehabilitation;serious games","Games;Prototypes;Training;Senior citizens;Medical services;Visualization","","2","","6","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many sufferers, however, do not approach mental health professionals with their disorders in the first place. This project aims to create a game that is accessible and low-cost and that shields the user from societal stigma to an extent. This game aims to enable the user to indirectly work out of an anxiety attack by starting at a difficult level and ending at an easy level (contrary to traditional gaming convention). Several psychologists have claimed that this game could be effective at managing anxiety symptoms, with an average rating of 65% being awarded for the game's effectiveness at managing anxiety.

These games usually offer playful routines that require players to perform full body movements in order to interact with the game. While this is often well-received by elderly users, this approach has some limitations that can lead to negative effects in the aged cohort. The main one being, that gameplay and exercise must happen concurrently. This, unfortunately, places limitations on the elderly users and limits the range of exercises that can be delivered. Also, prior studies have revealed that while the aged cohort often finds this approach enjoyable, they are more inclined to exercise in more traditional ways. This paper describes the design and development of an asynchronous game, called Solitaire Fitness, where physical exercise and cognitive gameplay do not occur at the same time. The game is designed to enhance both cognitive and physical abilities.

Young people could provide part of the solution for this problem by spending more time with the elderly but negative intergenerational perceptions prevent this and create a generational gap. Serious gaming has the potential to develop positive intergenerational perceptions as shared leisure activities and improve health and well-being of elderly. Therefore the research question for this paper is what factors are essential for the adoption of a serious game to bring elderly and youth together? The qualitative study conducted 36 interviews amongst elderly (above 65) and youth (below 25) applying the USE IT interview protocol. The theoretical value of this paper found 13 design factors, from which five factors were found to correspond with the interviews: Weighing of different motivations young and old; Need for a learning component; Options for a short game; Ease of Use and Communication and nature of social interaction. The empirical study also found that the awareness of intergenerational games is very low and must be addressed. The games must be fun and secure and be available on a multiplatform in the browser so computers are not excluded.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882443","serious gaming;Intergenerational play;Intergenerational perceptions","Games;Senior citizens;Interviews;Task analysis;Entertainment industry;Databases;Technological innovation","","3","","38","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Approximately a third of individuals over the age of 65 fall every year, with 20-30% of falls resulting in injuries that reduce independence and impair mobility. Considering older adults form a sizeable and increasing proportion of the world's population, falls and fall-related injuries pose a major challenge within society. For older adults, effective fall prevention has the potential to reduce serious fall-related injuries, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, nursing home placements, and functional decline. Game orientated exercise (exergames) represents a potential tool for supporting fall prevention intervention. Exergames are a commonly accepted method of encouraging physical activity, in an effort to promote health. This study investigates the efficacy of a physiotherapeutically designed fall prevention program, utilizing an interactive modular tile (IMT) exergame technology. A combination of objective and subjective measures were evaluated within this study, to assess impact of the exergame intervention on fall risk. The results indicate that IMT-based exergames are a beneficial tool for supporting the provision of fall prevention interventions in older adults. Overall results demonstrated reduced fall risk for the majority of participants, with particular benefits noted in dynamic balance.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882465","exergame;fall-prevention;older adults;physiotherapy","Color;Injuries;Games;Tools;Training;Senior citizens;Presses","","4","","11","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This serious game wants above all that everyone can fully know the four priorities of action: (1) keep calm, (2) evaluate the situation, (3) identify the dangers, and (4), call for help. For practical purposes, the domain of early childhood has been selected to train educators for five typical major accidents they will probably encounter with children. Two of these accidents were fully developed, parameterized, and tested. This paper focuses are: first, on the medical and social needs, demonstrating how important first-witness reactions are in an emergency scene; second, on how different domain experts and professionals were brought together; third, on how the software was developed based on an educator-centered design.

Each ID ring has an RFID integrated circuit (IC) and can thus be “activated” by placing the shirtsleeve next to the specific ID ring. The shirtsleeve-integrated antenna has bands going around the wrist, thus increasing the read range even when the ring is behind the wrist. This cost-effective and maintenance-free solution can be seamlessly integrated into our everyday clothing, as well as into furniture, textiles, and items around us. The presented first prototype of this system, which can be used when sitting by a table, allows wireless controlling of technology by simple hand movements.

This phantom limb representation is also reflected in the body image of the patient and can be associated with painful and non-painful sensations. Commonly, phantom limb appearance and pain is assessed with questionnaires, interviews and analogue drawings onto a 2D human outline. However, for patients it is hard to express the characteristics and sensations of the phantom limb and for clinicians it is challenging to compare and track patient testimonials. Our aim was to develop and evaluate a digital program to visualize phantom limb appearance and position, as well as pain and cramp hot spots of the phantom limb, on a 3D human model that represents the body image of the patient. Usability results show that a variety of upper limb impairments and pain areas can be adequately represented using this software. A 3D avatar is modeled after the patient's body image and not only the appearance of the phantom limb itself can be depicted, but also its somatic abnormalities, such as telescoping. In addition, every dimension of the 3D model can be quantified, to not only provide a visual and qualitative analysis, but also quantifiable results for longitudinal analyses and comparison of different groups. Pain intensity and cramps can be drawn directly onto the rotatable 3D model to accurately reflect the patient's perception. The 3D body image perception visualization tool CALA offers a novel and innovative computer-assisted method for the realistic representation of body, phantom limb and pain perception.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882450","","","","3","","26","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While automated evaluation procedures exist, AMD OCT analysis often requires verification or modification by a trained OCT evaluator. With millions of OCT scans performed per year, demand for new evaluation approaches increases. Human computing has proven to be an effective way to crowdsource a variety of scientific problems, as well as leverage human pattern-recognition ability. Video games allow users to interact with the scientific data while also leveraging the elements game developers require to maintain engagement. The authors investigate whether game interactions can train players to evaluate AMD OCT images, creating Eye in the Sky: Defender, which designed gameplay around OCT scan evaluation while supporting the desired outcomes via game mechanics rather than explicit training. In early prototype testing, results suggest player learning within four OCT-image-based game levels. Evaluations of accuracy using the mean user line input reflected a 92% improvement from a players' initial image evaluation. Spearman rank correlation and Procrustes analysis indicate mean user line accuracy within 10% by image 4 and improved results compared to the automatically generated line in more challenging images. These results suggest Human Computation games can train users to analyze AMD and OCT scans, encouraging expanded research.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882430","Human computer interaction;Big data applications;Game design;Serious games;Human computing;Crowdsourcing;Entertainment Industry","Games;Manuals;Retina;Training;Robots;Prototypes;Optical coherence tomography","","1","","26","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to create an immersive experience, a full-body avatar is essential. We reconstruct a full-body avatar by tracking the position and orientation of the head, hands, feet, and hip. To track the arm movements, the user has to hold two HTC Vive controllers. Additionally, the user has to bind Vive trackers to both ankles and the hip. We apply some of the most popular Inverse Kinematics (IK) methods to estimate the full-body pose. We perform parameter optimization to analyze the damping constant, the maximum number of iterations, and error value for the position as well as rotation. We made several tests between the IK methods in terms of the accuracy and the time to solve the IK problem. The results show that Damped Least Squares (DLS) outperforms the other methods. We furthermore conducted a user study to evaluate the subjective quality of the DLS method. Evaluation results show that the motion reconstruction for lower-body is very accurate; however, for the upper-body, some inaccuracies can occur. Such a motion reconstruction approach can be used in VR exergames, e.g., users can learn different poses while observing the movements in a virtual mirror and by looking down towards their own body.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882429","Full-Body Motion Reconstruction;Immersive Virtual Reality;Inverse Kinematics;Joint Configuration","Avatars;Jacobian matrices;End effectors;Tracking;Kinematics;Hip;Optimization","","14","","21","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out comparing the BBT and VR-BBT assessments. The test-retest reliability was also explored for the scores gathered with the virtual tool. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the game-like system correlated with the validated measures of the physical BBT, with a strong test-retest reliability. This fact suggests that the virtual version of the BBT could be used as a valid and reliable indicator for health improvements.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882472","automatic;assessment;manual dexterity;Parkinson’s disease;neurological rehabilitation;virtual reality","Reliability;Manuals;Sensors;Tools;Parkinson's disease;Automation","","6","","18","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods of stress therapy are expensive and have low adherence levels. There is growing research in the area of biofeedback (BF) games, in order to provide cheaper and more engaging alternatives. In our previous work, we presented three BF games, and showed how these games helped manage stress better than traditional stress therapy activities, like Paced Breathing. Given the crucial role engagement can play in determining the effectiveness of learning stress self-regulation in our biofeedback games, in this paper we investigate how best to quantify engagement physiologically. To achieve this, we pursue two main goals: 1) provide a framework for evaluating player engagement, and 2) develop machine learning models to predict levels of engagement during these stress therapy activities. Our main contributions are to present a metric for engagement based on physiological profiles, provide a benchmark for engagement levels and present a combination of evaluation criteria to determine if a BF game session was Highly Engaged (HE) or Poorly Engaged (PE). Additionally, for each evaluation criterion, we build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict if the BF game session can be labelled as HE or PE. Our work, especially relating to levels of engagement, can easily be generalized to analyzing other physiological profiles using breathing rate and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882481","","Games;Physiology;Stress;Heart rate variability;Task analysis;Standards","","4","","24","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The JSP under stochastic process times (JSP-SPT) is more complex than a regular JSP because of uncertainties associated with the process. Classical approaches for solving the JSP-SPT ignored characteristics of uncertainty, which will spend more computing time of obtaining near-optimal solutions. To solve the JSP-SPT efficiently, an algorithm that integrates the artificial immune system with ordinal optimization, abbreviated as AISOO, is presented to search an excellent solution at low computational costs. Firstly, the JSP-SPT is presented as a stochastically constrained optimization problem. Secondly, the AIS is utilized to determine an excellent solution of the JSP-SPT to minimize the tardiness within a limited computing time. The AISOO method is employed to a JSP-SPT with 6 jobs and 6 machines. The stochastic process times are in exponential, truncated normal, and uniform probability distributions. Simulation results reveal that the excellent solution has significant improvements in computational efficiency, while maintaining reasonable solution quality.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882476","physician task scheduling;job shop scheduling;stochastic process times;artificial immune system;ordinal optimization","Task analysis;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Job shop scheduling;Optimization;Immune system","","","","21","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While importance of detecting acute stage of disease by a measurement, long-term physiological measurement giving chronological information of health has been considered as a promising methodology for maintain one's health. However, sometimes, long-term continuous measurement by oneself has still been difficult without strong intervention by medical doctors. Achieving of habitualizing measurement must be dependent on subject's motivation in most cases. Besides this, we have developed physiological measurement by using sensors embedded into game devices such as VR display to assess mental information during playing. Here, it is considered that if physiological measurement would be combined with game devices and the measurement procedure become fully-automatic, the physiological parameters can be obtained automatically at every game playing. If this would be possible, the certain people (perhaps the so-called ""Gamer"") who play games daily would be automatically measured then huge amount of physiological data could be obtained. In this ideal case, the ""Gamers"" would become healthier or more easily maintain their health than ordinary people who would not play game daily. We call this paradoxical future outlook as “incorporating physiological measurement with gaming” and believe that this can be a possible health management methodology in the near future. In this concept, we have preliminary attempted to develop sensors, photoplethysmography; arterial cardiac pulse sensing that can be embedded in a VR headset and electrodes for electrocardiogram (ECG) formed onto gamepad to derive ECG during gaming.

The system developed targets users of computers and mobile devices, detecting and warning users to the occurrence of eye fatigue situations and suggesting corrective behaviours in order to prevent more complicated health consequences. The implementation resorts to machine learning techniques, using eye images datasets for training the eye state detection algorithm. OpenCV Lib was used for eye's segmentation and subsequent fatigue analysis. The final goal of the system is to provide users and health professionals with quality data analysis of eye fatigue levels, in order to raise awareness over accumulated stress and promote behaviour change.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882438","Eyestrain;Computer Vision Syndrome;Web Application","Fatigue;Computer vision;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Servers","","1","","11","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Diagnosis of children’s vision problems through video games : Case study: A visual acuity test & game tool","J. Vilaça; D.

Specifically, this review examines video game potential to allow the implementation of a subjacent diagnosis system, in the context of a study case: The optometric LEA vision test. A first approach exposes and discusses the context in which video games were considered relevant through the management of the engagement factor (considered as a key point in game adoption and will to participate). Since the case study focuses on the underlying capability to perform the diagnosis with a significant level of confidence in the children's visual acuity, a reflection on the necessary information support system, knowledge base and learning capacity is made. The technical aspects required for the game implementation are then exposed, followed by performance considerations (which certainly have an impact on the end-user experience, and therefore on engagement and concentration). Finally, a conclusion underlines the most relevant aspects in the context of the study case.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882470","visual acuity test;Optometric LEA vision test;serious game","Games;Visualization;Pediatrics;Protocols;Medical services;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays","","3","","7","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Application of Simple Game to Rapid Measurement of Cognitive Function in Maternal Brain","H. Kotani; M. Sugai; K. Kuramoto; M. Kato; M. Matsuno; H.

Forty healthy subjects were recruited from women living in Tokyo and the surrounding area, Japan. Ten were not pregnant (mean age ± SD: 21.1 ± 0.7) and 30 were postnatal. As it turned out, the postnatal subjects were divided into three groups (n=10) in accordance with the progress of their child raising: within only a year (mean age ± SD: 33.0 ± 3.8), one and a half years (mean age ± SD: 33.6 ± 4.1), and approximately two years (mean age ± SD: 36.9 ± 4.7). All the postnatal subjects were delivered of their first child. To begin with, we investigated variations in a woman's cognitive function after a time of childbearing, employing simple card games and a Groton Maze task. Secondly, hemodynamic changes at the prefrontal areas were measured using a multi-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) apparatus equipped with 3×5 probes (22 ch). For the fNIRS measurements, we used two hearing tasks: the sound of baby crying, and the Chopin's nocturne as a control. Finally, we evaluated the changes of our subjects' emotional states in chronological order after their time of childbearing. The accuracies relating to OC learning in the postnatal women with one and a half years after childbearing were significantly higher, as contrasted with the nonpregnant ones (P <; 0.01). Furthermore, speed to GMLT task in the postnatal group was significantly higher, as contrasted with the nonpregnant one (P <; 0.01). In the results of our fNIRS data for the postnatal women, we detected the correlations between cognitive functions and prefrontal hemodynamics corresponding to functional changes in a women's hearing, as contrasted with the data results for the nonpregnant ones. Our findings support the idea that postnatal women's cognitive functions are closely connected with memory as well as their prefrontal hemodynamics corresponding to functional changes in female hearing capabilities.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882451","Serious Game (SG);female brain;childbearing;pregnancy;CogState","Task analysis;Games;Pediatrics;Pregnancy;Hemodynamics;Probes;Psychology","","","","34","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The absence of a standardized method to quantify the severity of DP is problematic, being the severity of the condition the main factor for the recommendation of a specific treatment. To improve the quality of assessment of DP and thanks to the recent emergence of novel software solutions to process point-clouds, 3D surface acquisition of the infant's head is performed. Although these strategies proved their added-value, they have high costs and require medical training to learn how to correctly manipulate the geometry acquisition system and the software. However, no 3D synthetic and realistic models are currently available, hampering the development of novel methods. In this sense, the future purpose of this work is to generate an artificial benchmark of 3D models of infant heads with deformational plagiocephaly and make it freely available to potentiate the development of these novel methods. Thus, a selection of the best parameters that characterize plagiocephaly is here performed. To create a parametric model of the head with DP, measurements retrieved from state-of-the-art studies and 40 clinical magnetic resonance images of infant heads (33 with normal shape and 7 with mild deformity) were extracted and evaluated. We expect to apply these parameters in a future work on an artificial intelligence framework to generate the models.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882444","artificial dataset generation;deformational plagiocephaly;parametric modeling;3D head models","Three-dimensional displays;Head;Solid modeling;Shape;Pediatrics;Magnetic heads;Computational modeling","","2","","31","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observed that during emotional expression in response to negative stimuli, participants displayed increased amplitudes of the skin conductance responses, in comparison to the natural observation of neutral pictures and to emotion regulation. These results are in accordance with previous findings obtained with medical-grade devices. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of this system to be implemented in large-scale settings, particularly in psychopathological conditions marked by severely impaired emotion regulation ability, such as depression and anxiety.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-0300-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2019.8882437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882437","emotion regulation;electrodermal activity;psychophysiology","Skin;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Reliability;Visualization;Bluetooth;Libraries","","","","24","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
