However, age simulation suits have drawbacks in accessibility. As an alternative to a physical arm movement impairment induced by an age simulation suit, we designed a virtual arm movement impairment inside a virtual reality environment by using a visual tracking offset and a transparency effect. We compared our virtual movement impairment with the physical movement impairment of the “adit” age simulation suit and to a baseline without impairment in a between-groups user study (N=30). We investigated perceived arm movement impairment, task performance, presence, usability, and simulator sickness. Results show that the virtual impairment we designed can elicit comparable experiences as an age simulation suit while offering more flexibility and adaptability with users. With our paper we want to contribute to designing more effective visual pseudo-haptic effects for virtual reality age simulations.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978590","age simulation suit;physical movement impairment;pseudo-haptic sensation;virtual reality;visual delegate","Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Visualization;Tracking;Virtual reality;Serious games;Haptic interfaces","","1","","51","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This can lead to traumatic brain injuries, fractures, and even death. Being able to identify those at risk is imperative. In the past few years, game technologies such as the Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Dance Mats, among others, have shown to be very effective in discriminating fallers from non-fallers. In a prior study, the authors proposed a Virtual Reality-based system to assess the risk of falling in the senior community. In this paper, we explore the accuracy of this system by comparing it with a well-established fall risk assessment tool. More importantly, we also investigate the effects of using three different avatar visualization modes in delivering this test (top-down view, puppeteer view and first-person view). We hypothesized that: (1) the VR system would show high similarities to the original version of the test; and (2) altering the sense of presence of our subjects would allow them to fully immerse and concentrate on the assessment tasks resulting in more accurate diagnosis data. Results suggest that the proposed VR-based system was fairly accurate in computing the fall risk assessment test. Also, participants reported quicker reaction times in the VR system suggesting that the proposed tool offers higher levels of immersion and intuitiveness.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978560","falls prevention;virtual reality;gamification;clinical assessment","Technical management;Statistical analysis;Sociology;Time measurement;Serious games;Reliability;Risk management","","","","14","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of them is the effective combination of game design and development aspects with the therapeutic activities aimed at prevention, diagnosis, and motor rehabilitation. Aiming to help people with sensory-motor disabilities to acquire, recover or maintain their range of motion, wearable devices with sensors can be incorporated into the design to estimate and measure kinematic and dynamic parameters. The use of wearable technologies brings potential benefits in supporting therapeutic exercises but also increases the challenge, as it will require finding a proper balance between the particularities of the sensors, the game design, and the protocols established by health professionals. Many parameters associated with muscle biosignals, such as speed, joint angles, body gravity center, reaction forces, tremor, and overall progress of patients, can be obtained using wearable devices. However, their use combined with serious games for sensory-motor rehabilitation requires proper mapping of the signals acquired through the sensors into useful metrics to support therapists in treatment planning and monitoring the patient's evolution, and how both will be linked into the game design.

Serious games have been investigated as an alternative instrument to overcome the constraints of traditional methods. The use of serious games for cognitive screening is still a relatively new field of research, with previous works mostly focusing on finding out whether there is a correlation or not between games and cognitive performance.

Current medication dispensers aim to aid patients; however, they still have inherent operational flaws. When dealing with blisters, the manual refilling of a dispenser is a lengthy and error-prone task. Also, as medication inside dispensers is stored out of its blisters it is exposed to air and humidity, which hinder its potency. To solve these issues, we aim to develop a new medication dispenser which removes pills from their packaging only when needed. This paper presents a system to be implemented in said dispenser, which automatically detects pills and locates their best deblistering spot, so they can be extracted in the most efficient way. The proposed system can be split into two phases: On the first phase a custom-trained Mask-RCNN detects pills and classifies them according to their type. On the second stage, a custom image processing algorithm calculates the ideal location where pills can be deblistered. Firstly, a dataset containing images of different types of pill blisters was created and thoroughly annotated for Mask-CNN. Afterwards, Mask-RCNN was trained to detect pills and classify them according to their shape. From the resulting pill masks and classifications, an image processing algorithm is applied to calculate the ideal pill deblistering location according to previous research. By correctly identifying each pill inside a blister and finding the best spot to extract it, the system can be implemented in a new medication dispenser, which only needs to be supplied with blisters.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978601","Pill dispenser;MRCNN;Deblistering;Research","Training;Shape;Image processing;Neural networks;Manuals;Packaging;Classification algorithms","","3","","16","EU","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, and based on the rudimentary methods of analyzing these exams in the past, computer-based approaches are now used in ECG analysis. Smart technology systems have been designed over time to diagnose cardiovascular conditions through ECG analysis. The current study evaluates the robustness and performance of one Artificial Intelligent (AI) system, based on a Convolutional Neural Network paired with a Multilayer Perceptron, to classify specific cardiac conditions in ECG signals. The paper assesses the robustness of the described AI model, by evaluating its performance in the classification of different classes. Moreover, it was studied the influence of the model's parameters in the result, namely: Train-Test split ratio, learning rate, optimization Algorithm, and a number of epochs. After finding the optimal parameterization configuration that translates into a higher and better accuracy of the system, the results suggested that heartbeat classification based on CNN+MLP architecture is robust and capable to deal with the class increase. Our goal is to use outcomes and intelligent systems to automatically process ECG signals, and to directly identify specific medical conditions, and, for that, we intend to study the influence of the parameter's variation and confirm its robustness to the variation of the database configuration.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978589","European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(grant numbers:UIDB/05549/2020,UIDP/05549/2020,LASILA/P/0104/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978589","Artificial Intelligence;MIT-BIH;CNN;Deep Learning","Pathology;Databases;Electrocardiography;Robustness;Classification algorithms;Serious games;Convolutional neural networks","","1","","23","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first present the main strategies focused on minimizing cybersickness problems in virtual reality. Following this, we propose a guideline framework based on CS causes such as locomotion, acceleration, the field of view, depth of field, degree of freedom, exposition use time, latency-lag, static rest frame, and camera rotation. Additionally, serious games applications and broader categories of games can also adopt it. Additionally, we categorized the imminent challenges for CS minimization into four different items.

Leg Agility objective evaluation through optical devices is often investigated for telemedicine applications. Moreover, remote rehabilitation for PD subjects through virtual exergaming is becoming a popular approach thanks to its versatility, increased user engagement and the possibility of coupling it with remote monitoring tools. This work investigates if lower-limb exergaming may also be exploited for assessment purposes similar to traditional evaluation. In particular, if there exists a statistical difference between the kinematic description of Leg Agility versus the one of a Bouncing Ball exergame, as provided by an optical (RGB-D) acquisition system suitable for remote monitoring.

This paper presents a systematic review of VR/AR/MR applications for promoting physical activity (PA). We reviewed 39 papers from 5 databases that met the inclusion criteria. The review results show that (1) VR-driven interventions were more common than AR and MR interventions, (2) more interventions were targeted toward the general public, (3) most interventions adopted exergames as the approach for designing their systems, (4) the self-monitoring strategy emerged as the most used persuasive strategy while tailoring was the least used strategy, and (5) the majority of the interventions were perceived to be effective in promoting PA.

In the majority of cases, cardiac arrest is witnessed out-of-hospital where execution of BLS including resuscitation through by-standers becomes indispensable. However, survival rates of cardiac arrest victims could significantly increase if people were more familiar with the BLS process. In this context, technology-enhanced BLS training approaches utilizing Augmented (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been proposed in recent works. However, most of these approaches are not compliant with the medical BLS guidelines or focus only on specific steps of BLS training such as resuscitation. Furthermore, most of the existing training approaches do not focus on automated assessment to enhance training effectiveness through fine-grained real-time feedback. To overcome these issues, we present a novel AR- and VR-based training environment which supports a comprehensive BLS training compliant with the medical guidelines. Our training environment combines AR-NR-based BLS training with an interactive haptic manikin that supports automated assessment, real-time feedback, and debriefing in an integrated environment. We have conducted a usability evaluation where we analyze the training effectiveness and cognitive workload of BLS training based on our AR and VR environment against traditional BLS training.

As a form of attentional loss, IB occurrence might cause severe outcomes due to limited cognitive resources. Varied methods have been explored to reduce the IB effect and avoid neglect of critical information. Attenuating attentional loss via aided guidance with different sensory modalities intervention could be a possible way to address this issue. This study investigates how different sensory modalities affect the cognitive performance and IB effect from behaviour and neural changes in the human brain and how could we apply this in attention training for attentional loss improvement. Two experimental sessions were conducted, with a multisensory oddball task designed in virtual reality (VR) as the main task to attract individuals' attention. In session 1, participants responded to the main task without being informed of the unexpected task-irrelevant patterns in the background, while in session 2, they were informed of the unexpected patterns but still attended to the main task. Thus, participants were divided into IB (unaware of the pattern) and Aware (aware of the pattern) groups based on their awareness of patterns in the first session. Our results revealed that this VR-based design successfully induced the IB occurrence, with four out of nine participants reporting being unaware of the unexpected patterns. Further, the multisensory oddball task showed better performance in cross-modal stimuli (visual-auditory, VA) with higher accuracy and shorter reaction time than in uni-modal (A or V) conditions. Interestingly, in session 1, the IB group showed better performance than the Aware group, indicating that the IB group was not distracted during the task since they were unaware of the patterns.

Based on the experiment results, stimulus response of skin conductance could be measured with all the electrodes. Copper-based fabric and densely embroider silver electrodes give the best EDA response, which is comparable to that of commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The next step is to integrate these textile electrodes into gloves and socks and carry out EDA measurements on female and male adults as well as on children.

Moreover, the exercises require the therapist to manually move the patient's affected limb continuously through many repetitions, which can become tiresome. Currently, the integration of robotic systems in rehabilitation is very promising as robots can reduce the therapist's workload while ensuring repeatability and can increase the intensity of the exercises in a controlled manner. Also, the use of games and VR has been an attractive solution to motivate and increase the commitment of patients during extended periods of rehabilitation. This paper presents a framework that connects a robotic arm with the Unity3D game engine for robot assisted upper limb rehabilitation with game-based elements. The framework response time was tested in three network configurations with increased stress levels to verify if it is secure and robust for medical use. Results show that in the worst case, the framework's average delay is 80ms and reacts to communication errors at max 300ms. The framework shows that it is viable to integrate in a medical environment using a direct connection. Precautions need to be taken if it is placed in a public network, as results show that the more side-traffic there is, the higher and more unpredictable the response time becomes.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978593","FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal; European Union; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978593","Upper Limb Rehabilitation;Collaborative robots;Unity;TCP/IP;Communication Framework","Three-dimensional displays;Games;Robot sensing systems;Reliability engineering;Delays;Serious games;Time factors","","2","","20","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a study is conducted to this treatise measuring workload and emotional state using heart rate and achieved hit accuracy at different difficulty levels to test the feasibility of these measurements in exergames. The discretely measurable data are combined with subjective assessments of users to gain insight into a correlation with individually perceived workload.

Amidst all these burgeoning data points, the respiratory rate remains a crucial descriptor of health, well-being, and performance. While the traditional modes of measurement are accurate, they remain impractical for long-term respiratory rate measurement in an ambulatory setting. Interestingly, respiratory rate can be estimated from physiological signals like Electrocardiogram, Photoplethysmogram, and accelerometer waveforms. While respiration rate estimation from these methods is accurate when the subject is at rest, the estimation is thrown off by motion artifacts and a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio during ambulatory movement. Addressing this issue, this work presents a novel Deep Learning-based multitasking network that jointly predicts both respiratory rate and the respiratory waveform, thus aiding in an overall reduction in error scores during various activities, including walking, running, etc. Apart from comparisons against the previous state-of-the-art approaches, this work thoroughly discusses the practical aspects of adopting a Deep Learning approach during inference and briefly alludes to the tradeoff between time complexity, parameter counts, and accuracy. While the proposed approach improved overall estimation accuracy, it inevitably requires more parameters and runtime than a traditional approach.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978572","ECG;Accelerometer;Deep Learning;Respiration Modulations;Breaths per minute (bpm)","Deep learning;Analytical models;Uncertainty;Statistical analysis;Estimation;Multitasking;Probabilistic logic","","2","","18","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce this loss of visual acuity, occlusion therapy is often beneficial for people with Amblyopia, yet this conventional rehabilitation method often suffers from low compliance and adherence rates due to its repetitive nature. Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) applied to occlusion therapy games has a unique potential to engage players and stimulate their visual acuity. Advances in modern untethered Head-Mounted Display (HMD) systems that increase the accessibility of iVR open up new opportunities for more significant serious games interventions with Amblyopia. To this end, this paper investigates Project Star Catcher, a novel serious iVR HMD exergame refactored as a short 3-minute gaze-based color-matching intervention, and examined the game's effects on the vision of adults with Amblyopia. We present a pilot study [N=51 adults with Amblyopia] that measures changes in LogMAR visual acuity between the serious game (moving a drone to catch shooting stars) vs placebo (moving a drone in an empty starry sky) and younger adults (under 39 years old) vs older adults (39+ years old) from a mean age split comparison between users. Our results suggest that 3-minutes of serious iVR gameplay with experiences such as Project Star Catcher can significantly improve near distance visual acuity by over a mean of 6.2 letters when compared to placebo. We also found that older adults improve their near-distance visual acuity seven times greater than younger adults from gameplay. This paper concludes with discussion and considerations on utilizing iVR HMD serious games for visual acuity and Amblyopia.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978582","Immersive Virtual Reality;Serious Games;Games for Health;Head-Mounted Display;Visual Acuity;Amblyopia;Lazy Eye;LogMAR;Ophthalmology","Training;Visualization;Stars;Medical treatment;Games;Resists;Virtual reality","","2","","43","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several mobile applications are developed to aid mental health treatment and mobile sensing applications help remotely monitor patients with mental illness, understand key factors like sleep and exercise, and deliver effective treatment methods. Though new smartphones are increasingly efficient, the majority of mental health applications transfer data to centralized servers for processing. In this paper, we propose a Federated Learning framework for Mental Health Monitoring Systems (MHMS) to preserve user data privacy, reduce network usage and improve performance. To detect depression using the Federated Learning framework we defined a mobile application architecture, and developed two versions of applications that collect three types of sensing information such as location, accelerometer and calls. We defined epochs and developed an anomaly detection algorithm that helps to label local data to train models. We conducted a preliminary study for 6 weeks using two app versions. The results from the study indicate the app implementing the Federated Learning framework is capable of continuously tracking data utilizing less power, storage space and internet data. It also preserved users' privacy. In future, we are planning to implement Federated Learning to run large-scale studies with improved server-side federated averaging methods.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978600","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978600","Federated learning;Sensors;Smartphon es;Monitoring;Mobile sensing;Mental health","Privacy;Federated learning;Mental health;Depression;Sensors;Mobile applications;Servers","","4","","25","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research introduces a configuration of technology that reduces the knowledge gap of what is required to successfully achieve high accuracy and realistic control of a robot in real-time. The system implemented in this paper utilises an infrared camera from Leap Motion to capture and track hand gestures and movements, a Kuka 6 DOF robot and software packages to follow the hand movements from the UltraLeap Leap Motion Controller (LMC) in real-time, and an HTC VR headset for a mixed reality experience where two cameras are placed in the robot work-cell to send back a 3D stereoscopic image to allow the operator to have an immersed experience when remotely controlling the robot. The system proved to have a repeatability of approx. $\pm \mathbf{10}\mathbf{mm}$, and an accuracy of 0.1mm. The gripper was able to successfully pick up 86% of the time, with a final test of gripping an item and guiding it through a bandsaw at an average rate of 24.2 seconds.

Their perception of the distance and their hand were scaled in three counterbalanced conditions: under-scaled (scale = 0.83), not-scaled (scale = 1), and over-scaled (scale = 1.2), where the scale value is the ratio between the virtual reach that they perceive in the virtual environment (VE) and their actual reach. In each study condition, six data were measured −1. Real World Reach (pre-exposure), 2. Virtual Reality Baseline Reach, 3. Virtual Reality Not-Scaled Reach, 4. Under-Scaled Reach, 5. Over-Scaled Reach, and 6. Real World Reach (post-exposure). Our results show that scaling a person's movement in virtual reality can help improve reach. Therefore, we recommend including a scaling factor in VR games for people with Parkinson's disease.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978555","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1350995,IIS-2104819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978555","Virtual Reality;Parkinson's Disease;Rehabilitation;Reach;Scaling","Parkinson's disease;Virtual environments;Virtual reality;Serious games","","","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, depression among all age groups has increased significantly. As mental health is often stigmatized among older aged people, it is less openly discussed or treated. We propose a mental health monitoring approach that limits explicit user interaction, using Fitbit smartwatch data to determine depressive tendencies in older-aged people. We analysed physiological user data extracted from a Fitbit Alta HR device and use this data to train a machine learning model to detect depressive tendencies. While this is not a diagnostic tool, the aim is to identify physiological signs early on and direct the user toward professional medical guidance and treatment. We trained 19 predictive models on our dataset, the gradient boosting regressor outperformed all other models. The best performing model achieved at R-square of 0.32 although most models were poorly performing. Due to the limited sample size, there is a risk of model overfitting. Although these preliminary results are promising for one model, they would need to be replicated in a larger sample of older people, who exhibit a wider range of depressive tendencies.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978305","depression;geriatric;older aged;elderly;mental health;smart watch;smart wearable;quantitative","Wearable Health Monitoring Systems;Pandemics;Sociology;Mental health;Predictive models;Depression;Serious games","","3","","54","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though conventional method like capnography provides accurate detection of VT1 episode, its utility is limited to lab settings. Thus there is a requirement to detect the same through wearable devices due to its application in real-world settings, using parameters coming out from the same such as Heart Rate (HR), Breathing Rate (BR), etc. The most popular parameter currently in use to determine VT1 threshold is HR through Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). However, HR measurements are often susceptible to motion artifacts that would bias the DFA results due to high movement activities. Thus, in this paper we have explored the utility of BR to compute VT1, due to its resistance to motion artifacts. We have used DFA to calculate the same obtained from the Gas Based Method. We further validated the model by doing a feasibility check using the Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP). We observed an increase in BR and a decrease in alpha range with successive incremental workloads. The $\alpha_{br}$ obtained using DFA marked the episode of VT1 at $\alpha=0.75$ as evidenced in HR measurements. We have presented a Bland Altman analysis, to evaluate the effectiveness of BR to determine VT1, using the reference device (based on the Gas Analysis Method) and wearable device (based on RIP). The experimental evaluation showed agreement between the reference VT1 and the estimated VT1 derived from BR with close to 100% BRVT1 point lying inside the limit of agreement.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978306","Heart Rate (HR);Breathing Rate (BR);Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA);DFA estimates;Ventilatory Threshold (VT1)","Heart rate;Resistance;Fluctuations;Wearable computers;Time series analysis;Estimation;Serious games","","1","","16","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major reason for this can be attributed to sitting in poor postures for prolonged period of time. Maintaining such postures, especially under high mental workloads, may lead to reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV), leading to increased stress levels, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular health disorders such as heart attacks, strokes, etc. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of both right and poor posture on HRV during high mental workload conditions. We recorded the Heart Rate (HR), using chest based wearable, of ten healthy subjects under controlled environmental conditions. All the measurements were obtained with each subject maintaining different postures such as High Power (HP) pose, Low Power (LP) pose, High Power pose under mental load conditions (HPm), and Low Power pose under mental load conditions (LPm). HRV indices like time domain and frequency domain for the above postures were computed. We observed that eight subjects showed higher HRV during HP pose compared to LP pose. Likewise, the subjects showed higher HRV during HPm pose compared to LPm pose. We studied the impact of postural change on HRV through statistical t-paired test and observed a significant difference $(\mathbf{p} < \mathbf{0}.\mathbf{05})$ in the HRV indices across subjects for different postures. Hence, this study demonstrated the positive impact of the right posture on HRV of individuals having desk jobs.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978565","Heart Rate (HR);Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Posture;Chest Wearable","Power measurement;Data analysis;Frequency-domain analysis;Stability criteria;Human factors;Stroke (medical condition);Real-time systems","","","","23","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, players can decide on breast cancer biopsy procedures and the sequence they should handle each medical device. In addition, based on breast cancer findings, players can simulate and recommend Chemotherapy and Hormone therapy treatments, choosing routes of administration, doses and periodicity schemas. In particular, with the help of expert collaborators from the health area, we compiled and structured a representative and up-to-date collection of worldwide medications to treat the most common breast cancer types used in the game. Furthermore, to contribute to the players' learning process, the history of decision-making of each player over time is saved automatically. This feature allows visualizing each patient's breast cancer treatment journey along the years and learning based on trial and error, modifications, repetitions, searches, and replaying the game as needed using different players' decisions. Players work toward a health goal, choosing actions and experiencing the consequences of those actions through active learning.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-8439-8","10.1109/SEGAH54908.2022.9978558","University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR)(grant numbers:DPDI 79/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978558","decision-making game;simulation;breast cancer;biopsy;treatment;patient clinical cases","Visualization;Medical devices;Chemotherapy;Biological system modeling;Decision making;Biopsy;Breast cancer","","1","","31","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, engaging in self-care behaviors such as physical activity or daily weight-monitoring can be difficult due to lack of knowledge or motivation. Digital games can serve as an alternative to traditional patient education to provide information and motivate engagement in critical self-care behaviors. In this paper, we describe a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) in which game play is driven by the player's real life self-care behaviors.
