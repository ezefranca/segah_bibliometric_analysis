While VR provides immersive experiences, it still does not offer an entirely perfect situation, mainly due to cybersickness (CS) issues. In this work, we propose a novel approach for predicting upcoming CS symptoms. Our solution is able to suggest whether the user of VR is entering into an illness situation. We adopted random forest classifiers and validated our solution using 16 different machine-learning techniques, which presented the best results. For training purposes, we built our own dataset through a CS profile questionnaire that we also propose in the present work. The questionnaire is focused on registering and identifying the user's susceptibility to CS, considering their historical conditions and also their response to the immersive environment developed by us. In this method, 86 individuals are selected and the developed questionnaire was put to them on different days, and the answers are compiled as dataset. Our proposal also identifying attributes responsible (causes and individual's parameters) for the observed stressful and uncomfortable situations.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201649","head mounted displays;causes;prediction;neural networks;machine learning;user experience;cybersickness","Games;Machine learning;Visualization;Virtual environments;Resists;Acceleration;Biological system modeling","","11","","48","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Another solution is behavioural treatment that does not seem to present better results than medication for a higher cost. A novel method with growing interest is the use of neurofeedback (NF) to teach the patient to self-regulate symptoms by herself, through the visualisation of the brain activity in an understandable form. Moreover, virtual reality (VR) is a supportive environment for NF in the context of ADHD. However, before proceeding the NF, it is important to determine the features of the physiological signals corresponding to the symptoms' appearance. We present here a novel framework based on the joint measurement of electroencephalogram (EEG) and sight direction by equipment that can be embedded in VR headset, the goals being to estimate attentional state. In parallel to the signal acquisition, attentional tasks are performed to label the physiological signals. Features have been extracted from the signals and machine learning (ML) models have been applied to retrieve the attentional state. Encouraging results have been provided from the pilot study with the ability to make the right classification in multiple scenarios. Moreover, a dataset with the labelled physiological signals is under development. It will help to have a better understanding of the mechanism behind ADHD symptoms.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201699","Virtual-Reality;Eye-tracking;Brain-Computer Interface;Machine Learning","Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Physiology;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Virtual environments;Medical diagnostic imaging","","5","","32","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors are therefore proposing a concept for a mHealth solution entitled “recover-App”, especially designed for supporting people in stationary rehabilitation. Its core features are intended to support patients overcome certain psychological problems that occur during prolonged periods of recovery by using concepts and interventions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). “recoverApp” was designed based on a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis and incorporated feedback from therapists to further refine it's main features. These include functions to track the patients mood, tasks, challenges and skills. It also provides the patient with a diary and an instant messaging feature to directly contact the treating therapist. The patient receives skill points by completing challenges and tasks or by simply entering diary entries.

A specific tag can be switched off by covering it with a hand, which change can then be used as a digital input to any connected device. Because of the used passive UHF RFID technology, there is no need for embedded energy sources, but the interface platform gets all the needed energy from the external RFID reader. In this study, two test setups were created to an office environment: For the Body Test, the interface was integrated into a cotton shirt and into an item. For the Table Test, the interface was integrated into a wooden table. A gamelike testing software was created for both setups and two male test subjects tested the platform. The achieved results were very promising: success rates of 99-100 % and 94-98 % were reached in the Body Test and in the Table Test, respectively.

Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201889","virtual patients;simulations;serious games;non-player characters;agent-based models","Games;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Switches;Biological neural networks","","1","","64","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, the healthcare sector has been gradually gravitating towards telemedicine, which applies intelligent systems for more comprehensive medical services with minimum costs. The criticality of data and process involved in telemedicine raise various concerns in terms of reliability and security. To this end, in this paper, we propose HapiChain, a blockchain-based framework for patient-centric telemedicine. HapiChain exploits blockchain technology to improve security, scalability, and reliability of medical workflows. Although HapiChain is patient-centric, it also helps the clinicians to save time and prevent unnecessary trips without improvising the level of treatment. In HapiChain, we embed two primary telemedicine services, namely telemonitoring and teleconsultation. For the former service, Hapicare, an existing healthcare monitoring system with self-adaptive coaching using probabilistic reasoning, is used. HapiChain then completes this service by adding teleconsultation services exploiting blockchain technology. The HapiChain framework includes three main layers: (i) interface layer, (ii) DApp layer, and (iii) blockchain layer. In the first layer, Hapicare is used to communicates with the users, i.e., patients and doctors. DApp layer includes the required procedures for security and scalability of HapiChain, namely smart contracts and distributed storage. The latter is achieved using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In the blockchain layer, Ethereum blockchain is used as a platform of DApps. We evaluate the HapiChain framework and the proposed teleconsultation services in a use-case.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201726","Blockchain;Telemedicine;Teleconsultation;Medical Workflow;Ethereum;IPFS","Telemedicine;Medical diagnostic imaging;Senior citizens;Diseases","","19","","18","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we have proposed a digitized game that is able to magnify the impact of one of the strategies of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This can provide an opportunity for self assessment of individuals' emotional state and enhance impulsive dominance on positive thinking. We have developed a serious game Militant of the Maze (MoM), accessible via handheld devices (e.g. cell phone, tablet) that comprises strategies of CBT that emphasizes the consequence of `alternation' to prevail over challenges of everyday life. We hypothesized that perseverance of the ability of `alternation' can notably improve treating the patients dealing with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The experimental outcome demonstrated that the existence of `alternation' in gameplay can significantly improve players' positive affect and decreases the negative affect, which can impact improving the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment by influencing players' mindset of opting for an alternative solution while confronting circumstances in everyday life.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201621","serious games;psychotherapeutic strategy;gameplay;player experience","Games;Medical treatment;Mental disorders;Mood;Method of moments;Handheld computers","","5","","37","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed and validated the design of a personalized physical activity recommender system for exergames based on a study of participant's preferred activities. The proposed approach resulted in more accurate recommendations when comparing to an existing model in predicting users' preference toward physical activity types.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201820","exergame;player modeling;recommender system","Recommender systems;Games;Predictive models;Adaptation models;Image color analysis;Machine learning","","9","","34","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, keeping users engaged for long periods of usage is a constant challenge, especially in cases of diseases that cannot be cured, such as diabetes and cardiac insufficiency, which require long-term care. Some applications adopt gamification as a strategy to keep their users motivated to follow the medical recommendations repeatedly. As a reward, they usually make use of virtual currencies, points, and badges. However, in the case of adults 50+, this engagement can be even more particular, where research points out to a different perception on what motivates them to achieve well-defined and more significant purposes than pure entertainment in games. This paper investigates how to project reward elements on gamified health platforms for this audience, suggesting what can satisfy their intrinsic motivations to engage them for a future continued use of an m-health app. We have found that excess reward elements can be harmful and have the opposite effect of what usually m-health applications are designed for. Besides, the first boost coming from a close friend or family can be determinant to motivate them intrinsically or even to change their routine, more than coming from a health agent. Finally, we conclude through an m-health gamification framework focused on adults 50+.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201658","gamification;framework;m-health;rewards;game elements","Games;Diseases;Monitoring;Sociology;Statistics;Diabetes","","4","","55","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces ClothFace technology by presenting a batteryless glove-integrated user interface. The solution is based on passive ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The first prototype of this solution was fabricated from copper tape to a normal cotton-based glove. The user interface on the glove consists of three antenna parts on three different fingers of the glove, each of which has an RFID microchip with a unique ID. Further, an additional antenna part is attached to the thumb of the glove. The antennas are initially separated from each other, and none of the microchips is readable for the RFID reader. When thumb antenna touches any of the three finger antennas, the touch creates an electrical connection, and the corresponding microchip can be detected by the RFID reader. In this study, the developed glove-integrated user interface was evaluated in an office environment by three test subjects, who all received 100 orders from a specific testing software. The average success rate in this first test was 98 %. These initial results are very encouraging, especially when considering that the glove-integrated user interface, being light, flexible, and cost-effective, promises versatile interesting applications in several fields.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201793","antennas;glove;intelligent clothing;passive UHF RFID;user interface;textile electronics;wearables;wireless systems","User interfaces;Integrated circuits;Testing;Antennas;Fingers;Passive RFID tags","","4","","22","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The game employs various persuasive strategies based on the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) framework to boost players' motivation and provide an enjoyable experience. We believe that our game will yield improved physical activity levels among adults by encouraging them to regularly engage in light-intensity activity (e.g., slow-walking), moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk-walking), and vigorous-intensity activity (e.g., running).

The kernel of the SG intelligence system uses IRT to calculate player's latent personality trait. The trait Conscientiousness was approached in the present work. A study was conducted with a 29 subject sample of all genders. The SG was capable to identify their personality trait and the IRT intelligence system proposed is adequate.

Our system aims to provide automatically the FMA score for six items focused on the upper extremity (UE) and one item of the balance section. For that purpose, a depth camera was used to track the user's movements and reproduce them in a virtual environment. Interactions within the virtual scenario are designed in order to quantify the performance level using two approaches: virtualization and gamification. The first approach was implemented for evaluating the UE functioning while the second approach was used in the postural stability assessment. Thus, not only the traditional FMA score is given, but a further descriptive indicator can be obtained, providing additional information about the patient's performance.

However, producing enough narrative content to cover long rehabilitation periods could require much effort from the authorial point of view. Having a tool that, given a wide enough knowledge base, can virtually produce an infinite set of stories, could greatly help in addressing this issue. For this reason, we explored the field of automatic story generation, designed and developed a multi-layered tool capable of automating the creation process of stories. The tool allows the user to define constraints at setup-time to ensure that a given set of events will appear in the generated story plot. These events may be mapped to specific serious games, making the resulting stories suitable, for instance, for integration in exer-games based rehabilitation platforms.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201843","narrative generation;procedural content generation;exer-games;user engagement;serious games","Games;Knowledge based systems;Tools;Probabilistic logic;Data structures;Task analysis;Media","","","","34","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within this context, the detection and prevention of accidents are paramount to ensure a longer life expectancy for the elderly. Over the years, many approaches for fall detection have been proposed, such as ambient sensors, wearable devices, and automated camera monitoring. A recent approach is to use pose estimation software to identify humans and pinpoint the location of their most important joints. This pose information can be later used as features for an effective fall detection system. This scenario begs the question: Can pose estimation methods be as effective as the sensor or other camera-based ones? To answer this question, we analyzed three pose estimation frameworks, totalizing eleven models, paired with a simple neural network classifier. In our experiments, we have obtained competitive results among the state-of-the-art on the UR Fall Detection dataset, a multi-modal fall detection benchmark, comprised of RGB, depth, and acceleration data. More specifically, our best model achieved a sensitivity rate of 94.5% and a specificity rate of 99.9%, in line with the best camera and sensor-based solutions.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201701","fall detection;neural networks;pose estimation;evaluation","Feature extraction;Pose estimation;Neural networks;Cameras;Acceleration;Neurons;Sensors","","12","","28","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Immersive technologies, virtual and augmented reality in particular, are capable of providing interactive, engaging, and safe training scenarios, showing promise as com-p~ementary training tools. However, current virtual fundoscopy training solutions typically fail to provide an effective training experience. In this paper, we present the results of a preliminary study conducted to examine three approaches to simulating the direct ophthalmascope as part of training. The approach uses different virtual and augmented reality user inputs. Preliminary results suggest that the operation of a physical controller that maps finger movement to direct ophthamloscopy operation allows for more usable interactions and lower cognitive load than hand-tracking gestures, which are limited to pinching.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201804","Augmented reality;eye examination;hand tracking;usability;virtual reality","Training;Tools;Indexes;Valves;Electronic mail;Tracking;Head","","","","42","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hypothesize that integrating interactive elements into 360° videos will affect its perceived immersion, engagement, and usability. In this paper, we present a framework for adding interactions to 360° videos composed of an editor and a video player. The Editor allows adding interactive content in the form of panels containing information, quizzes, pictures, and 3D models. A three-stage study was conducted with participants from the Ontario Tech University (n=45) to evaluate our VR framework's usability and engagement compared to a non-interactive 360° video by applying the SUS (System Usability Scale) and the GEQ (Game Experience Questionnaire) surveys. Results indicate that the interactions add tension, higher negative affect, and lower positive affect than non-interactive videos that led to higher perceived usability with the non-interactive version.

Indispensable in our growing hyper-technological and hyper-stimulative society. SR deficits are associated with diverse behavioral problems and mental disorders such as depression, rumination, distraction, anxiety, stress, and attention control. Neurofeedback Training (NFT) is one of the techniques to train brain self-regulation (BSR). In the current protocols, the benefits from NFT greatly differ between subjects, with a high percentage of inefficacy. Therefore, understanding how to prime self-regulation could be the key to unlock predictors and optimize the success of Neurofeedback modulation, and vice-versa. Literature hypothesizes that the “optimal” state of SR learning is reached when irrelevant associations between internal states and external reward are avoided, and when the learner stays engaged, focused and undistracted. Thus, suggesting a close relation to focused attention forms of mindfulness meditation (MM). As such, to promote this “optimal” self-regulation on an NFT protocol, we implemented a human-computer framework to assist the subject to voluntary modulate their brain activity. The assistance was done by priming the subject with mindfulness guided instructions right before the NFT. In conclusion, conducting this intervention was the first step to determine if priming with external neurostimulation would enhance Neurofeedback self-regulation.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201841","Self-regulation;assisted neurofeedback;neurostimulation;mindfulness;neuromodulation","Task analysis;Neurofeedback;Training;Protocols;Bars;Visualization;Electrodes","","2","","29","EU","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
