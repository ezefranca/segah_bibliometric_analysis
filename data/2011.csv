Patients suffering from such dementia, for instance Alzheimer's disease, lose efficiency in cognitive spheres such as memory, planning skills, initiative and perseverance. Some researchers tried to evaluate the potential of close-to-reality simulations and generic video games for brain training to stimulate the cognitive abilities of AD patients. Using recent advances in artificial intelligence such as learning, activity recognition and guidance to enhance this concept of training, we are proposing, in this paper, a detailed explanation of an adapted serious game we designed for this purpose. A prototype has been developed showing how to exploit AI techniques to create an affordable and accessible tool for cognitive training and allowing in-game estimation of the patient's cognitive performance.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165447","algorithms;design;human factors;cognitive training;cognitive performance;serious game;alzheimer's disease;cognitive impairment","Games;Training;Artificial intelligence;Aging;Alzheimer's disease;Adaptation models","","50","1","26","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research introduces a set of 3D games which require the sorts of repeated movements considered effective in the reacquisition of post-stroke motor skills. A system that uses markerless motion capture technologies to track and identify human low-level motion, i.e. the movement of hands and hand gesture to control the games, is described.

One solution is to design a modular application were adaptations can be made in order to meet the patient specific needs, in the presence of the play, meaning and reality components, but also in functionality. Different functionality is needed for non-intenders (play), intenders (meaning) and actors (reality).

The second module is the game play in which the player attempts to mimic the virtual instructor. Gestures are measured in real-time and then compared with the prerecorded Tai Chi gesture template corresponding to the displayed movement. Visual feedback indicates how well the player imitated the instructor. The proposed system is not designed to classify gestures but to evaluate the similarity of a given gesture with a gesture template. The Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) method is applied to compute such similarity. The proposed approach (1) facilitates the design of assessment tools in which the user has to follow a sequence of predefined movements and (2) applicable to other domains, such as telerehabilitation.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165450","Serious Games;fall prevention;Tai Chi;wearable inertial measurement units;movement analysis;gesture evaluation","Games;Training;Image segmentation;Acceleration;Sensors;Protocols;Hidden Markov models","","11","2","25","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The laparoscopic surgery success greatly depends on surgeon skills and training. To achieve these technical high-standards, different apprenticeship methods have been developed, many based on in vivo training, an approach that involves high costs and complex setup procedures. This paper explores Virtual Reality (VR) simulation as an alternative for novice surgeons training. Even though several simulators are available on the market claiming successful training experiences, their use is extremely limited due to the economic costs involved. In this work, we present a low-cost laparoscopy simulator able to monitor and assist the trainee's surgical movements. The developed prototype consists of a set of inexpensive sensors, namely an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer and a flex sensor, attached to specific laparoscopic instruments. Our approach allows repeated assisted training of an exercise, without time constraints or additional costs, since no human artificial model is needed. A case study of our simulator applied to instrument manipulation practice (hand-eye coordination) is also presented.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165446","surgical training;laparoscopy;serious games","Instruments;Surgery;Training;Laparoscopes;Games;Magnetic sensors","","10","","21","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the ever increasing demand for oil derivatives in the international market. The extraction of this mineral, however, is not an easy process. It poses many hazards which may threaten the environment and the lives of workers at an oil well. In order to reduce the chances of accidents and failures, a continued training program is highly recommended. This paper presents a serious game which simulates a drilling rig. In this game players are exposed to various circumstances in which they can exercise their knowledge about their work and learn what to do in troublesome events. Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to the game in order to accomplish that feature. Due to the fact that oil and gas exploration activities are defined in project structures, the project-based learning theory is applied to support this work. The application also includes instant interactions among several players in a virtual 3D environment. The game is web-based, which allows players to remotely execute it on different platforms.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165431","educative games;multi-agent systems;virtual reality","Games;Training;Servers;Object oriented modeling;Electronic learning;Virtual reality","","9","","35","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this aim, we adopt the Web Squared paradigm, combining serious games with crowd-sourcing and automatic data gathering from smartphones' sensors. We show how this combination can create a major force able to tackle serious challenges considered too complex for single users and even for computers. As a proof-of-concept, we discuss a solution able to automatically generate a Google Maps-like service also including information about traffic lights with audible signals. As a final result, our solution improves crossroad accessibility for blind pedestrians by exploiting the latest Web Squared and serious game technology.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165451","accessibility;blind user;serious game;smartphone;Web Squared","Games;Smart phones;Databases;Google;Sensors;Servers;Global Positioning System","","9","","16","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to test this system a pilot study has been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital to understand the potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists who `played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional rehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another using a mixed reality version of the same game were held.

What we propose is to use 3D computer simulations in such a versatile way that those simulations could act as learning objects designed directly by those who own the experience we want to be transmitted. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to create a model in charge of communicating learning objects and simulators. This model ensures that, on the one hand, the simulation offers an interface to the learning process stable enough not to be affected by every small change. On the other hand, the model also ensures that the simulation offers a mechanism for adopting changes in the learning process. The key to solve this contradiction is to take the complex behavior of the simulation objects out of their control, leaving in them just very basic behaviors. This paper presents the problem and the design proposed to solve it in a more detailed way.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165445","computer simulation;e-learning;haptics;surgery","Solid modeling;Haptic interfaces;Surgery;Computational modeling;Training;Virtual reality;Computers","","7","","12","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technology has this power. Aim: This study aimed to assess the impact of using Nintendo Wii® in the elderly. Methods: The impact in balance was measured using Berg scale, the activities of daily living using Barthel, cognitive status using MMSe and perceived health status using SF-36. A sample of 65 seniors from a nursing home was randomly allocated to 3 groups: Wii with the supervision of a Physiotherapist (Group A; n=23), Wii without supervision (Group B; n=20), and just Geriatric Gymnastics (Group C; n=22) during 20 sessions. Results: Better attendance and satisfaction were obtained in Group A. In physical terms significant better results were found in SF 36 on Group A and in Berg score of Group C. In mental assessment, a significant worse result was obtained in SF36 of Group A. Also significantly better results in Vitality and Mental Health of Group B were obtained. In therapy exposure, there were significantly better results in group A of the SF36 in individuals with more than 750 minutes (15 sessions). There were no accidents and/or injury registered during the sessions. Conclusion: The supervised use of the Wii, improves the physical component of the elderly and it also can be a motivating factor for exercise practice. This activity can bring better perception of the vitality of the elderly and physical functioning. In other aspects it may also have a depressive effect on some participants. This study highlights the importance of expert supervision when using a Wii as a therapeutic instrument in a senior population.","","978-1-4673-0434-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165441","Older Adult;Institutionalize;Physiotherapy;Nintendo Wii®;Wiitherapy;Geriatric Gymnastics","Games;Geriatrics;Senior citizens;Educational institutions;Diseases","","7","","36","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All these projects involve specific game elements but the designed products are not necessarily digitally. The projects share a design strategy that involves input from clinical practitioners and patients. This paper presents an overview of three projects. The first project has the aftercare of cancer patients as its topic. After breast cancer treatment, a large population of patients suffers from severe fatigue obstructing them to pick up their old life. A product was developed using the game elements tangible interaction and challenge to increase their energy management. The second project has a clinical group of soft-drugs addicted youth as its target group. The developed product aimed to increase their therapy adherence using game elements social coherence and tangible interaction. The third project has burn-out patients as a target group. The prototype consists of an online-game that aims to improve the patient's self-esteem and behavior. The used game-element is virtuality and amount of control. Gradually the game transgresses from low-interaction abstract games to high-interactive realistic role-playing.
