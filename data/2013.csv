In DS, cognitive skills are impaired, and learning requires personalized attention and specific special education approaches. In this context, computer mediated learning, and in particular computer games, are promising as potential tools for the personalization of learning and for engaging users in motivating and stimulating learning experiences. In this paper, we present a virtual reality gaming approach to support DS education, with particular emphasis in collective learning in small group settings. The proposed system addresses some of the main limitations in DS such as training of association and composition/decomposition tasks. Here we present the development of the system and results of a pilot study with special education instructors (N=3) and DS participants (N=4). The results show a high degree of acceptance and suggest that our system can be a valuable tool to support both, instructors and DS users, in the learning experience. In addition, our results support the use of integrated computer based interactive board systems with multiple DS users. We find that group settings seem to be more effective at engaging DS participants and encouraging their autonomy and initiative.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665299","human computer interaction;Down syndrome;trisomy 21;learning technologies;interactive board","Biomedical imaging;Pediatrics","","12","","19","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As cyber bullying may have a serious impact on the mental (and physical) well-being of victims, it is important to develop effective evidence-based interventions against cyber bullying. The “Friendly ATTAC”-project has the aim to develop so-called virtual interactive scenarios (i.e. digital games) to modify behavior patterns associated with cyber bullying among youngsters. The scenarios will be developed during brainstorming sessions involving people from the different disciplines and with different backgrounds, but specialized in the domain of cyber bullying. To allow this non-technical people to specify the virtual interactive scenarios that should be developed, we have developed a domain specific modeling language that allow them to do so in an intuitive and close to natural language way.

Fire keeps claiming a high number of victims. Some authors allege failures during the evacuation process as the main cause that contributes for that number. Fire drills are used to train buildings' occupants for emergency situations. However, fire drills' participants often have prior knowledge of their schedule and as result they are not as focused as they should. Moreover, fire drills require the mobilization of some resources, leading to financial costs. Performing a fire drill will always affect the normal functioning of the place where they take place; for this reason, sometimes they are not performed at all. In some special locations, like hospitals, fire drills are unsuitable. Emergency planning is crucial to prevent and minimize damage and victims. Albeit the improvement on safety measures, many occupants and employers in this type of buildings still lack adequate knowledge and training on how to behave in such hazardous situations. EVA is presented as a possible solution, which is based on the concept of Serious Game that can be used as a training tool for healthcare professionals. A preliminary prototype was developed. A sample of 20 subjects was selected to test it giving promising results. Results also showed that users who had training in fire prevention appear to perform better in the course. Moreover, participants who regularly play computer games overcame easily the game challenges. Further research and development are still to be explored, which are discussed in the concluding part of this paper.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665302","Serious Games;Evacuation;Emergency Planning;Building evaluation;Egress","Fires;Lead;Hospitals;Games;Personnel","","30","","14","IEEE","18 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To help in this task, metrics were developed to predict the evolution of the disease severity. One of the most commonly used metric in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is the SAPS II, based on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). However, the use of the more flexible Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provide better results when the association between the outcome and the continuous covariates is nonlinear. Neural networks have also been used for prediction namely those based in the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, as, in theory, they are universal approximators to any continuous function. Some studies have shown that their performances are equivalent to GLMs and, naturally, inspired by GAMs, Generalized Additive Neural Networks (GANNs) were proposed. Because the construction of a GANN is based in a subjective decision making process through the analysis of the residuals plots, studies to automate this process emerged originating new methodologies (AutoGANN). However, these are not free from problems when the number of variables is large. Some improvements were then introduced for model selection, such as, a multistep algorithm that allows more than one modification at the same time in GANNs's architecture. Methods described above have correspondence to evolutionary programming as the search of a better result is performed by small modifications, closely resembling the mutation operator. AutoGANN method and Genetic Algorithm were used in order to find optimal models for predicting mortality at an ICU. These models, as well as a MLP model, were compared regarding their predictive and discriminative abilities.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665306","","Equations","","3","","30","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current treatment methods can result in weight loss in the short term but often fail in the longer term. Increasing motivation and thereby improving adherence can be a key factor in achieving the needed behavioral change. One approach is to address affective state (i.e. to promote positive emotions) by making people aware of their condition in a playful manner, possibly with peer interaction. Serious gaming is envisioned as one way to achieve this. Based on a study of the scientific evidence, the serious game `Healthy Weight Game!' was designed. The design incorporates most of the features shown to be beneficial in the scientific literature. An evaluation of the design involving a survey of 53 subjects produced positive results. The game was well understood and seen as a good method to help people lose weight and induce positive behavioral change. It was seen as a good addition to own initiatives for being physically active and as a useful addition to dieting and physical therapy. The design of the game (appearance and content) was positively received. Some gender differences were found in reactions to features such as visualization of goal achievements (e.g. avatar getting thinner as exercise goals are reached) and the kind of informative feedback which was appreciated. Overall the game design was rated 7.57/10 over all respondents. We conclude that this design demonstrates potential for improving physical and, indirectly, mental health of people facing overweight and obesity by increasing adherence and promoting sustainable behavioral change. Next steps are to implement the game and conduct a larger scale evaluation.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665311","Serious gaming;lifestyle change;obesity;E-health","Games;Atmospheric measurements;Energy measurement;Particle measurements;Visualization;Convergence;Force","","15","","22","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to elderly isolation which is a major risk factor for suicide. Moreover, if isolation is coupled with physical illness and incapacitation, such a risk increases exponentially. To fight back this problem, roboticists have been proposing solutions to autonomously monitor, support and even promote physical activities among the elderly. Nevertheless, those appear as very high-cost and complex solutions that require an advanced technical expertise. Recent off-the-shelf solutions, such as the well-known NAO robot, emerged as possible alternatives. An extension to the NAO robot, denoted as RIA, is being developed at the Engineering Institute of Coimbra (ISEC). The RIA is not only built for a social interaction with the elderly but also as an autonomous tool to promote professional care through the analysis of health and environmental parameters. Therefore, the RIA robot is an adapted NAO low-cost platform equipped with several sensors that can measure different parameters like body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. By validating this valuable platform, the foundations were laid for a whole new paradigm in elderly care.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665313","","Robots;Lead","","18","","12","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system addresses the specific problems of producing cartoon animations, where the main objective is not to reproduce realistic movements, but rather animate cartoon characters with predefined and characteristic body movements and facial expressions. The techniques employed in Palco are simple and easy to use, not requiring any invasive or complicated motion capture system, as both body motion and facial expression of actors are captured simultaneously, using an infrared motion detection sensor, a regular camera and a pair of electronically instrumented gloves. The animation process is completely actor-driven, with the actor controlling the character movements, gestures, facial expression and voice, all in realtime. The actor controlled cartoonification of the captured facial and body motion is a key functionality of Palco, and one that makes it specifically suited for the production of cartoon animations.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665314","","Tracking;Switches","","2","","10","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adherence to physical activity is low in older adults, therefore new possibilities to motivate to exercise must be explored. One of this new possibilities is to use exergaming. In this paper, we present an assistive tool for monitoring daily, physical activities in older adults with access to exergaming in their home environments. The proposed system employs the Kinect device and allows one to analyse the body movements. From a pilot study, we proved that the system can detect movements through exergaming. In the future we plan to implement the developed monitoring tool as well as exergaming in nursing homes.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665315","","Hip;Foot","","8","","20","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Microsoft Kinect is a low cost depth sensor that promises to provide a convenient markerless interface for the user, while maintaining the robustness and 3D tracking capabilities of sensor based devices. Evaluation of Kinect's operating characteristics and safety issues is presented. Implementation of a robust hand tracking software system to enhance the tracking capabilities provided with the `out of the box' SDK is also detailed. This system is used as an input method for several stroke rehabilitation games, designed in collaboration with Health Psychologists, Stroke Users Groups, Community Support Team for a previous project based on Nintendo Wii hardware. This study demonstrates that the Kinect-based system presents the same tracking capabilities as our previous virtual glove project using Nintendo Wii hardware, whilst overcoming limitations imposed by the requirement of wearing a physical tracking device.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665316","Stroke;Kinect;Rehabilitation;Serious Games;Computer Vision","Tracking;Robustness;Cameras;Games;Computers;Rotation measurement;Time-frequency analysis","","12","","27","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, video games are rising as promising tools to guide patients through their recovery experience and to increase their motivation throughout the rehabilitation path. However, to be applied to clinical scenarios, video games must be designed to adhere to the clinical requirements and to meet doctors/patients expectations. They also need to be integrated within multi-level platforms that can allow different levels of monitoring, e.g., at a personal level by the therapist, at the hospital level by the doctors, and at the regional level by the government agencies. In this paper, we overview an intelligent game engine for the at-home rehabilitation of stroke patients The engine provides several games that implement actual rehabilitation exercises and have been developed in strict collaboration with therapists.

After a stroke, patients often complain about balance related problems or partial paralysis. Normal rehabilitation training depends on balance and strength exercises. In such cases balance plates are often used as training devices, but patients often report lack of motivation especially when training at home. The research objective of this publication was to develop a serious game using the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board. From a physiotherapeutic view it should help patients suffering from a stroke throughout their rehabilitation, especially to increase the motivation to do their exercises. Since every patient is different, the developed serious game can be customized by a physiotherapist for the individual patient's needs. A lot of customization options provide optimal support for the entire rehabilitation process.","","978-1-4673-6165-1","10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665319","rehabilitation;serious game;stroke;Wii Fit Balance Board","Sociology;Statistics;Navigation;TV;Prototypes;Hardware;Software","","21","","36","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
