"Rewards that make you play: The Distinct effect of monetary rewards, virtual points and social rewards on play persistence in substance dependent and non-dependent adolescents","M. M.

In this paper, we tested if different major types of game-rewards resulted in different play persistence behavior. Additionally, we investigated if rewards were suitable to apply in persuasive games within a therapeutic context for substance dependent patients, since people with substance-related disorders have a decreased neurological reward system. In a within-subject experiment, among 20 substance dependent and 25 non-dependent participants, we examined whether play persistence and reward evaluation were affected by three separate types of rewards (monetary rewards, virtual points, and social rewards) and by player type (substance dependent versus non-dependent adolescents). As to type of reward, results showed that participants played longer and evaluated the game more positively when playing for money. As to player type, in contrast to our expectations, both substance dependent and non-dependent participants were equally motivated by rewards. Moreover, the former group was even more motivated by monetary rewards in play persistence than the latter group.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401312","gamification;play persistence;reward types;addiction;youth","Games;Sensitivity;Face;Brain;Design engineering;Entertainment industry;Medical services","","3","","74","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize sensors, a microcontroller, gaming technologies to create a cost effective serious game. The modular design allows it to be extended or modified easily and rapidly according to the subject's profile of cognitive and physical abilities, and also could be used as an outcome measure of cognitive training. The serious game consists of a motion-sensing controller, a rhythm game and a cognitive skills evaluation approach. First, to interact with our serious game, the elderly players are asked to perform physical actions like acupressure points' slapping to activate the motion sensing controller. Second, they need to overcome challenges from the rhythm game. The challenges are composed of three game scenarios and each one can activate a specific cognitive skill like response speed, short-term memory or working memory. During the game's playing, the serious game will record the elderly's gameplay data. With this data, we propose a gameplay data analysis approach to evaluate the elderly players' cognitive skills in short-term memory and working memory. Finally, we conducted an experiment to test the feasibility and discover phenomena which may be helpful in the improvement of our serious game in future.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401314","Cognitive Training;Physical Activity;Rhythm Game;Motion Sensing;Response Speed;Short-term Memory;Working Memory;Acupressure Points","Games;Senior citizens;Rhythm;Training;Two dimensional displays;Color;Sensors","","11","","14","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the underlying processes used in the design of effective purposeful games are understudied. Prominent among these, is the need to understand strategies that designers use to translate content into gameplay. We propose a method to elicit strategies used by designers. Our method uses protocol analysis within an experimental setup to study the purposeful game design process. This paper describes the implementation of the method, and the rationale for our decisions. The method was validated through a set of pilot studies. Through the results of these studies, we discuss the adequacy and limitations of the method and the modifications required. The results of the pilot study provide insights into the game design process. They suggest that our method is capable of revealing strategies used by designers in translating content from problem space to game elements. The main contribution of our work is the selection, adaptation and demonstration of a method to study game design practice in-situ, and thereby create a methodological foundation to discover processes and strategies for effective purposeful game design.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401315","game design process;purposeful game design;protocol analysis;endogenous design","Games;Protocols;Encoding;Task analysis;Interviews;Cognition;Prototypes","","2","","26","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A model for integrating human computing into commercial video games","C. Clark; I. Greenberg; M. Ouellette","SMU Guildhall, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX; Center of Creative Computing, Southern methodist University, Dallas, TX; SMU Guildhall, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX",2018 IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH),"2 Jul 2018","2018","","","1","8","Human Computing (HC) is a successful approach to crowdsourcing scientific research. Despite its success, many HC projects struggle to expand their user base and create sustained user engagement. In contrast, the commercial video game industry overall is very successful at encouraging users to spend significant time and resources to play over extended stretches of time, using techniques such as gameplay loops to engage players on many levels. When integrating scientific research into a video game, ideally the HC activities fit naturally within the gameplay loops and overall game themes, which game developers are best suited to accomplish. The authors propose a new HC to Video Games (HCtVG) model and associated framework, which provides a common means to connect HC research and video game developers. The HCtVG model comprises two major phases: Deconstruction and Analysis (DA) done by the researchers, and Game Integration (GI) completed by the game developers. During the DA, researchers deconstruct their research into a 5-Step Analysis Structure (5SAS) consisting of Suggest, Validate, Process, Select, and Exit steps. The 5SAS allows game developers to perform the GI phase, using the guidelines provided to integrate the HC activity into the gameplay and theme. This structure allows scientists to focus on their domain expertise while leveraging the skills of the game development community to design their video game integration. To demonstrate the HCtVG model, the authors apply the DA phase to an HC project seeking the discovery of chemotherapeutic co-medication properties for multi-drug resistant cancer research, and use the GI phase to design and integrate the HC activity into the popular game Minecraft.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401316","Human computer interaction;Big data applications;Game design;Serious games;Human computing","Games;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Guidelines;Cancer;Tools;Crowdsourcing","","6","","46","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although high game scores might provide an indication of higher cognitive and physical abilities, these are not sufficient to reliably determine the improvement in health outcomes. The work presented in this paper hence focuses on determining whether the collection of clinical measures during gameplay could potentially be used as a reliable indicator of improvement. For this study, the author uses the StepKinnection game for fall prevention, a Kinect-based game which builds on a hybrid version of the Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task, a validated test that has been shown to prospectively predict older fallers. A group of 10 independent-living older adults was recruited and asked played with the game for a 12 weeks period of time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and every four weeks. Stepping performance data collected through gameplay was compared to the validated CSRT test. Statistical analysis proved that the stepping performance data collected by the game correlated and agreed with the validated measures of the CSRT test, suggesting that this could be used as a reliable indicator for health improvements.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401317","Fall prevention;elderly;older people;games for health;clinical data collection;Kinect","Games;Task analysis;Reliability;Training;Senior citizens;Data collection;Aging","","4","","24","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effect of hand washing is also acknowledged by experts and the world health organisation (WHO). We propose a design based intervention employing behaviour change principles suitable for such households. The goal of the intervention was to nudge people to wash hands at appropriate times via self reflection. Our intervention induces self reflection through reminders and channel factors.

However, experts rarely have experience exploring design alternatives in a playful way, which is important when participating on the co-design of serious games like exergames. We explored the question: How can we involve experts to share and professionally explore their domain specific knowledge in a play-centric game design process? We present two co-design exergame workshops with physiotherapists. Based on lessons learned from the first workshop, we explored in the second workshop framing the entire workshop process as a game. We found that gamifying the workshop process into a design game provided a way to change the experts' effective-oriented mindset into a playful mindset.

The playability testing was conducted with a convenience sample of 30 participants, subdivided into 3 equal groups and randomly assigned to each game. Participants were asked to report any problem or negative issue they found during the play and to complete the Games Experience Questionnaire. Results showed some usability issues, mainly related to the lack of intuition and immediacy in the use of some commands. Overall participants experienced moderate levels of immersion and flow for the serious games (not designed to be immersive rather than educational), low levels of negative feelings such as annoyance and frustration and prevalence of positive emotions. Results imply that, with the aim to guarantee games effectiveness and efficacy, the game should be more intuitive and improve their correspondence between the commands and the in-game tasks to achieve the goals. Furthermore they have the right level of immersion and flow, which allow the balance between fun and investment of cognitive resources to learn genetic contents.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401344","heredity;mutation;genetic literacy;cardiovascu-lar risk;genetic risk;decision making;knowledge transfer;serious games;game design;usability","Games;Rabbits;DNA;Diseases;Usability;Testing","","3","","30","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This staff involvement cannot be fully replaced, as it is criticalfor performance assessment. However, if some live elements can be even partially replaced by online-supported formats, it can provide for more content-aligned, structured and replicable exercises while also creating cost efficiencies and reaching larger audiences. HPI together with the Transfer of Knowledge Team of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme is therefore exploring how to digitize parts of such training exercises.

Factors like isolation, social monotony, extreme living conditions, chronic stress, and interpersonal differences within the team can affect both crew wellbeing and performance. Therefore, we have developed a VR environments and VR games to study team dynamics, cooperation and cohesion among crew members. We have tested this game during 12- and 8-month long space flight simulation studies at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) facilities in Waimea, HI, where subjects underwent adjustments in physiology and lifestyle that are analogous to some of the challenges in a confined environment (HI-SEAS.org).

This means that when a child who has difficulty crossing the midline is confronted with actions that require the midline to be crossed, the child is unable to perform the action in the correct manner. When the midline is crossed spontaneously, paths in the brain are developed. This skill is essential for the advancement of various motor and cognitive skills. Children who have trouble crossing the body's midline, frequently experience difficulties with mundane, day to day activities. Understanding the challenges children who suffer from crossing the midline face, this paper focuses on the creation of an interactive game and particularly the development of an input device that could be used by children. It is postulated that the playing of an interactive game forms the required pathways to conduct movements that once did not seem comfortable or possible for the child. During development of the interactive game the guidance of occupational therapists was sought. What is unique about this project is the successful design of an affordable device, that can accurately simulate and guide the movement of the child in the process of treating their difficulty of crossing the midline. The project further provides scope for other gross and fine motor difficulties children have to be treated.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401348","Virtual environments;virtual rehabilitation;game design and development;serious games","Games;Medical treatment;Virtual reality;Training;Neuroplasticity;Task analysis;Tools","","3","","21","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is still very often a paper based and not really motivating or diversified process with the help of so called diabetes diaries. Today's society also delivers mobile solutions even with gamification elements, but the combination of monitoring blood glucose level and a complete independent/not directly related game was not yet the State of The Art focus.

Since horizontal saccades are the most representative of ocular movements, we use them as the main input for driving the kart. Eye blinking is a semi-autonomic and essential function that occurs naturally, so we decided to take advantage of it by using it as a secondary input to control the speed of the kart. This interface allows us to test the influence of machine learning techniques on game operation by inexperienced users and to evaluate whether it has a subjective positive impact. Two different versions of the game were implemented, one with a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (RLA) that moderates users' commands based on outcomes of past commands, trying to prevent collisions, and a version with direct control (without RLA). Five participants tested the two versions of the game, so that we could compare the player's performance and engagement.

We argue why anti rules can be a powerful means in preventing common mistakes in audio game design. In more detail, we present eleven anti rules which when followed are likely to spoil the user experience of an audio game.

Here, we focus on its design and production with polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C), to be assembled with a pump and an electromechanical (E/M) system in a water tank. Based on a patient-specific anatomical model and produced using a 3D printing technique and molding, the PVA-C phantom mimics the ventricles' natural anatomy and material properties, while the pump and E/M systems mimic the natural movements and pressures. The PVA-C phantom was assessed by imaging and measuring it using a four-dimensional ultrasound machine. The PVA-C phantom demonstrated to be a versatile option to produce patient-specific biventricular models, preserving their shape after manufacturing and presenting good echogenic properties. Both chambers were clearly seen in the ultrasound images, together with the interventricular septum and the myocardial wall.

This rehabilitation game is a home-based system that allows the patient to exercise at home, due to its Kinect-based portable setup.

In this work, we adopt the position based method to fast and robust model the dynamic behavior of catheter / guidewire and contrast medium propagation in vascular interventional radiology. Specifically, we simulate the elastic rods according to the cosserat theory and the contrast medium propagation is controlled by an advection-diffusion equation. Besides, we employ bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to achieve fast and accurate collision detection between vessels and rods and compute the response with the Coulomb's law.

We developed a first-person shooter video game that adapts its in-game difficulty and environmental settings based on a representation of the mental state of the user to keep a balance between the skills of the player and the challenge of the game. The mental state of the player is measured with their physiological signals, namely the heart rate and the beta band of the brainwaves, and we distinguish the mental state of the player with an accuracy of 87%. We also conducted an evaluation using self-perceived flow and in-game scores as metrics to compare the mental state-based adaptability with a performance-based version. Results show that the latter provided a better gaming experience, suggesting that further research is needed to fully understand the relation of flow and gameplay on FPS games.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401382","Videogames;flow;performance;adaptable gameplay;psychophysiology","Games;Physiology;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Heart rate;Atmospheric measurements","","11","","35","EU","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show here how a cloud-based platform featuring a flexible database, parametrized exer-games and a hierarchical description of the rehabilitation data allows to achieve this goal. In particular, a clear identification of different exercises macro-parameters is fundamental to effectively display a clear and meaningful view on the patient's status to the clinicians. Such parameters must be well matched to the mechanics of the exer-games and provide to the therapist a clear summary of patient's rehabilitation progress.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401383","exer-games;autonomous rehabilitation;remote assessment","Games;Avatars;Market research;Monitoring;Databases;Tools;Image color analysis","","10","","21","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within this topic, simulate MIKI in a patient-specific virtual environment can be used for pre-operative planning using the real patient's anatomy, possibly resulting in a reduction of intra-operative medical complications. However, the validated VR simulators perform the training in a group of standard models and do not allow patient-specific training. For a patient-specific training, the standard simulator would need to be adapted using personalized models, which can be extracted from pre-operative images using segmentation strategies. To date, several methods have already been proposed to accurately segment the kidney in computed tomography (CT) images. However, most of these works focused on kidney segmentation only, neglecting the extraction of its internal compartments. In this work, we propose to adapt a coupled formulation of the B-Spline Explicit Active Surfaces (BEAS) framework to simultaneously segment the kidney and the renal collecting system (CS) from CT images. Moreover, from the difference of both kidney and CS segmentations, one is able to extract the renal parenchyma also. The segmentation process is guided by a new energy functional that combines both gradient and region-based energies. The method was evaluated in 10 kidneys from 5 CT datasets, with different image properties. Overall, the results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed strategy, with a Dice overlap of 92.5%, 86.9% and 63.5%, and a point-to-surface error around 1.6 mm, 1.9 mm and 4 mm for the kidney, renal parenchyma and CS, respectively.","2573-3060","978-1-5386-6298-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401384","Computed Tomography;coupled B-Spline Explicit Active Surfaces;kidney segmentation;patient-specific virtual environment;renal collecting system segmentation","Kidney;Image segmentation;Computed tomography;Splines (mathematics);Training;Active contours;Standards","","4","","32","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
