Based on this potentiality, this work presents a general architecture for the development of educational web portals that support performance evaluation along the sequence of activities composed by serious games and virtual environments. The general architecture defines a set of services that can be used to organize and evaluate sequences of educational activities which involve games and virtual environments. A sequence of activities concerns an organization of applications, like games or virtual environments, aiming educational objectives. The activities are combined and arranged in hierarchical levels to offer challenges with different degrees of difficulty. The evaluation of the activity sequences is done automatically although is personalized by the mediator. The analysis is performed per level and based on accomplishment of the educational objectives selected by the mediator for the evaluation. The educational objectives were divided in three domains: cognitive, affective or psychomotor. This characteristic is important to address skills that go beyond the cognitive domain, like motor skills and personal values.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586225","learning in health;educational portals;serious games;virtual environments","Training;Games;Virtual environments;Portals;Context;Planning","","3","","11","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It requires fast diagnosis and treatment, since the survival rate decreases 7.6% for every hour without treatment. In order to facilitate this process of diagnosis and medical therapy, the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health issued a document regulating the implementation of a Sepsis Fast Track protocol based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Training of emergency department healthcare professionals is essential, and should be attended regularly in order to refresh knowledge and to be made aware of updates to any changes of the protocol. Currently, this training is conducted through traditional learning methods often considered as outdated for the younger generation, the so-called ""digital natives"". The usage of serious games is a trend that has been considered when discussing new tools for teaching and training in various fields, including healthcare. Several research works on the impact of applying such technologies in healthcare, stating that serious games could provide new approaches and opportunities have been published. This paper presents the Sepsis Fast Track serious game. It is a serious game developed to teach and train nurses and physicians working in hospital Emergency Departments on the Sepsis Fast Track protocol. An evaluation study carried out with the healthcare professionals is also presented. The main goal of which was to evaluate the impact of serious games on professional working practices.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586226","","Games;Training;Protocols;Hospitals","","2","","19","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our framework applies trials designed by domain experts that allow for standard repeatable measures across sessions and players. The game is designed to go beyond drilling skills; instead it aims to assess and customize learning.

The employment of digital puppeteering in addition to agent-based control of virtual characters (avatars) makes this virtual environment potentially helpful in enhancing protective skills meant to reduce risky drinking practices and associated behaviors. The presence of a human-in-the-loop avoids the shortcomings of pure agent-based control, affording an experience in which avatars respond appropriately to both verbal and nonverbal cues in dialogues with a user. Reflection (self assessment of how one handled different situations) and after-action review (feedback about one's performance from a coach) enhances learning from the experience.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586229","avatars;interactors;peer influence;protective strategies;reflection;virtual environments","Alcoholic beverages;Games;Virtual environments;Avatars;Animation;Computer science;Education","","4","","12","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People with severe chronic kidney failure are dependent on some form of kidney replacement treatment to survive. They are often eligible for several treatment methods and here the patient should be involved in the decision making, especially when the medical outcome is expected to be similar. This is important, as people are the experts on their life, values and believes and the different treatment methods each have unlike effects on daily life. However, knowledge is a barrier for these patients to actively take part in such discussions with their medical professional. This paper discusses a game-concept that is developed to give people more insight in the effects of a treatment on daily life, as well as helping them to evaluate the different treatment methods. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the development of additional patient information sources that focus on values and beliefs, and the effects of treatment on daily life, in order to empower patients in discussions with their medical professionals.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586230","game-based learning;game development;serious games;chronic kidney failure;shared decision making","Games;Kidney;Diseases;Senior citizens;Decision making;Medical diagnostic imaging;Hospitals","","1","","40","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One hundred and fourteen women ranging in age from 23-43 years (mean ± SD: 31.8 ± 4.3) took part in our experiment. Seventy-nine women were pregnant (mean age ± SD: 32.1 ± 4.9) and 35 were not pregnant (mean age ± SD: 31.1 ± 4.4). All the pregnant women were expecting their first child. Concerning the pregnant group, 33 women (mean age ± SD: 32.0 ± 4.0) continued with our experiment after their childbearing was concluded. On four questionnaire categories established by Hanazawa's protocol, we assessed each subject's feeling level for a child, a husband, a mood and their health. At the same time, we instructed them to carry out five kinds of tests: simple reaction, SR; choice reaction, CR; working memory, WM; one card learning, OC; and divided attention, DA using card games through a cognitive function test called “CogHealth”. The accuracies relating to the CR task in the postnatal women were significantly lower (t(18)=2.42, P <; 0.05), depending on the questionnaire scores about positive feelings for their husband. In the postnatal group, there was also an inverse correlation between their positive feelings for their child and a quick response to OC leaning (r= -0.46, P <; 0.05). Furthermore, the pregnant women who perceived that the women themselves might be in an unhealthy state were significantly higher in accuracy for the DA task among the five CogHealth tasks than pregnant women who believed their health was sound (t(77)=2.00, P <; 0.05). There were also no significant differences between subjects who considered themselves healthy and those who considered themselves unhealthy in each of the other two groups. Our findings confirm that pregnant and postnatal women's feeling levels are closely connected with their cognitive functions.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586231","childbearing;pregnancy;cognitive function;female brain;CogHealth","Pregnancy;Pediatrics;Mood;Biochemistry;Correlation;Rats;Protocols","","3","","40","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the underlying models are based on real data, each decision made by a learner affects outcome probabilities. Therefore the behavior of a VP reflects how a real patient with the same medical condition would have reacted to the learners' actions.

Unfortunately, the interface devices for these games often fail to maintain user engagement for sustained periods of time. By increasing the users' sense of presence within the virtual environment through careful interface design, we hypothesise that user engagement can be maintained. This results in continued use and positive health related gains. In this paper, firstly we introduce an interface for providing users with a natural, cost effective means of locomotion in a virtual environment. This interface is based on a modified elliptical walker (that can connect to any game) and facilitates natural locomotion by mapping the player's movement on the elliptical walker to their character in the virtual environment. We hypothesise that accurately reproducing a natural means of navigation through virtual environments will result in an increased presence compared with a traditional keyboard mouse interface and present our experimental results to support this hypothesis. Secondly, we discuss an application of the proposed interface to mental health - a virtual charity run named `Digital Miles' that was hosted and streamed online by the authors to raise money for an Australian mental health organisation. This application shows the potential of the interface to achieve people's fitness and well-being goals through game-play and raise mental health awareness among a wider audience.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586257","","Virtual environments;Games;Lasers;Legged locomotion;Navigation;Computational modeling;Wheels","","3","","38","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cognitive stimulation has been shown to decrease the rate of intellectual decay and potentially reverse age-related cognitive decline. Serious games provide new training opportunities to improve the decrease in selected social, sensory-motor, cognitive and emotional functions of elderly people. This paper details the objectives of the VIRTRA-EL web platform, which has been designed to evaluate and train cognitive skills to elderly users by means of serious games using the personal computer or tablet devices.

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and “laypeople.” The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique. This may be due to the differences of the systems and how the users interact within them. In a society where video games have become an integral past time, it is important to determine the role that video games play in the perceptual and psychomotor development of users. These findings can be generalized to domains outside of medicine that utilize robotic and computer-controlled systems, speaking to the scope of the gamers' abilities and pointing to the capacity within these systems.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586262","","Surgery;Robots;Measurement;Games;Training;Rails;Cameras","","2","","17","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently attention has focused on accessibility issues in this technology. This paper presents an analysis of 94 apps that have been specifically designed for people with visual disability or that could be used by them. The main characteristics of the apps will be examined in order to determine if could be considered as serious games and if they are suitable for users with visual impairments. We will encounter some difficulties in getting information about them because of current inappropriate classifications, unsuitable search terms and incomplete descriptions. Our objective is to improve their classification and therefore their searchability and their ability to make recommendations to users with visual impairment based on the user's profile and on information from their current context.

In this context, a difficulty adjustment system is proposed that takes user performance as input and generates two different responses: a) a change in the distance the user should cover, and b) the velocity provided to the target. User performance is estimated from its ability to achieve the targets (game score) performing movements. The system interference in user displacement value and target speed where chosen to stimulate the user to achieve specific rehabilitation goals. The game difficulty adjustment has received small attention in the context of rehabilitation robotics interfaces. It is important to note that games developed for rehabilitation differ from commercial entertainment games due to severe limitations imposed to patients by pathologies like stroke, cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury. An Evolutionary Algorithm (AE) based optimization strategy was adopted to adjust game's difficulty. A meta-profile for user behavior was also developed allowing to create and simulate different virtual users and game experiences in computer. This user profile includes a reaction time (time delay), motion disturbance and a kinematical motion profile based on a polynomial function. Using the meta-profile, different user motion behavior can be generated for exhaustive test and optimization of the difficulty adjustment system. The approach allows the reduction of development time and also the reduction in the number of experiments with volunteers.

The intervention applies motivational game based learning and behavior change theories during design. Latino American children are the main target group for this study as they have significantly high obesity rates due to socio-economic conditions and lack of awareness. There have been several interventions that have targeted game based strategies in the clinic to promote health outcomes and some have even targeted obesity problems, however to our knowledge this is the first effort that adds an in-home component to the clinical intervention. We discuss in detail the challenges faced while designing and implementing this hybrid clinical trial. Finally, we present the evaluation results from a randomized clinical trial that recruited 101 children.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586280","Serious games;health intervention;behavior change;obesity","Pediatrics;Obesity;Games;Avatars;Hospitals;Urban areas;Clinical trials","","5","","23","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"How would you like to be rewarded? Relating the Big-Five personality traits with reward contingency in a cognitive training puzzle game","A. Nagle; R. Riener; P. Wolf","Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Spinal Cord Injury Center, Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",2016 IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH),"10 Oct 2016","2016","","","1","7","Rewards in serious games have had a long and at times contentious history about their effect on intrinsic motivation, with contradictory findings about whether they are detrimental to intrinsic motivation or not. While recent research suggests that rewards can be beneficial, the effect of reward contingency on motivation is still unclear. The link between player personality and different motivations to play games, and the differing reward preferences arising from the different motivations suggests that personality could moderate the effect of a reward contingency on intrinsic motivation. Knowing this effect could help in better leveraging rewards to make motivating serious games. Two studies, therefore, were conducted to investigate the relationship between personality and reward contingency. In Study 1, 60 participants played a block-matching puzzle game that can train executive functions, with each participant randomly assigned to one of three conditions: performance-contingent rewards, which gave rewards after achieving a specific performance level, task-contingent rewards, which gave rewards simply for completing a task, and no reward condition. Big Five personality traits values of the participants were assessed and related to their intrinsic motivation and performance using a linear regression model. A different combination of the five traits significantly predicted motivation and performance in each condition, with the performance-contingent condition yielding significantly higher enjoyment and performance than the other conditions. The efficacy of the linear model was tested in a follow-up Study 2, where 30 participants played the same puzzle game, with half the participants given performance-contingent rewards, and the other half being assigned a reward contingency that would maximize their intrinsic motivation and performance based on the model obtained in Study 1. Enjoyment and competence subscales of intrinsic motivation, and performance, were significantly higher in the group that received a personality-based contingency as compared to the one that always received performance-contingent rewards. The present study highlights the role of personality in moderating the effect of different reward contingencies on motivation and performance, and could explain the contradictory findings of existing research. The results demonstrate that serious games can be made more motivating and performance-oriented by using appropriately chosen reward contingency.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586281","reward contingency;cognitive training puzzle game;moderating effect of personality;reward preference;intrinsic motivation;performance","Games;Training;Animation;Linear regression;Cost accounting;Switches;Pressing","","7","","64","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Louise is a new, semi-automatic prototype of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA), a virtual character interacting with users through social-like communication, adapted to the special needs of older adults with cognitive impairment; it is intended to ultimately provide assistance in their activities of daily living. We recorded and analyzed both videos of the conversation-like interactions and Louise's tracking data. In our experiment, Louise's attention estimation algorithm achieved about 80% accuracy; moreover, in almost all cases, the user's attention was successfully recaptured by Louise after a planned, experimenter-induced distraction. These results are in line with what was observed in previous experiments involving only younger adults, thus suggesting that attention measurement tools embedded in cognitive prostheses will not need to be adapted to elderly patients. Finally, to gain further insights on conversation management and provide evidence-based suggestions for future work, we performed an anthropological analysis of the whole experiment.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586282","Assistive technologies;attention;cognitive impairment;dementia;embodied conversational agent;older adults","Dementia;Senior citizens;Prototypes;Monitoring;Estimation;Speech;Engines","","16","","28","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alone over 700 citizens experienced severe traumata accompanied with neurological deficits during the Roman-Gaulish confrontations in the Asterix illustrated series. While recovery did not last long in the comic books, real-life traumatic brain injuries pose long-lasting disabilities to patients. One's daily routine is no longer routine, but rather a series of complex tasks which need to be performed in the correct order. Besides experiencing motor deficits and partial loss of executive functioning, activities of daily life become challenging. Hence, brain injury patients have to endure long-lasting, often strenuous rehabilitative sessions. Their brains need to be re-wired, and patients have to be re-enabled to self-reliantly perform activities of daily living. The goal is to come back to a point of prior healthy functioning. This paper introduces a novel technology-enhanced rehabilitation approach with a specific focus on cognitive abilities. The act of autonomously making a cup of coffee serves as an example for a new proposed serious game. Feedback of therapists who actively participated in this research suggests great benefits and high potential for the proposed serious game.","","978-1-5090-2210-6","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586283","rehabilitation;serious game;stroke;cerebral dysfunction;traumatic brain injury","Games;Brain injuries;Prototypes;Brain cells;Training;Medical treatment","","7","","24","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
