Therefore, more objective tools are necessary to complement the neurological examination and distinguish subtle changes in ataxia over time. Using virtual reality (VR), we aim to develop precise tools to measure the progression of FA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a series of 5 different upper limb tasks in VR with FA patients in order to determine how well they were tolerated, if they allow to distinguish FA patients from a control group, and if they correlate to clinical measures. Twelve FA patients and 9 healthy partici-pants underwent traditional assessment of upper limb function and of FA severity (patients only), performed the series of five VR task, and completed a subjective evaluation. Only 6 out of 12 FA patients were able to successfully complete all tasks, primarily due to the challenges associated with manipulating the controllers for patients with advanced stages of FA. Different performance metrics of the tasks were significantly different between groups and had strong correlations to a clinical assessment scale. All participants reported very low simulator sickness and a high level of virtual presence. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using VR with FA patients, although adaptation of the technology may be necessary for those with more severe impairments.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253802","Virtual reality;Friedreich's ataxia;Clinical eval-uation;Serious games;Motor assessment","Correlation;Atmospheric measurements;Virtual reality;Particle measurements;Serious games;Task analysis","","","","21","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since caring for people with dementia is very time-consuming and nursing homes are cutting staff due to cost pressures, the care sector faces enormous challenges in the coming years. However, regular training of certain physical exercises adapted to the individual state of health is very important for the health promotion and resilience of people with dementia. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a dementia robot that enables seniors to perform these exercises independently and flexibly. As dementia exercises that can be transferred to a robot, ball throwing, high-five game and strength exercises have already been derived in preliminary work. Based on this, an adaptive, optimizing and real-time interaction system has now been researched, which uses rule-based Fuzzy Logic to classify the degree of dementia and Evolutionary Algorithms to adapt the exercise parameters to the state of health. To develop the classifier, the expert knowledge of caregivers was collected using knowledge acquisition. The expert knowledge was formalized in a knowledge base using a hybrid inference mechanism. The results show that the degree of dementia can be correctly classified for the ball throwing, high-five game and strength exercise. Similarly, the exercise parameters can also be optimized with respect to individual therapy progress. The interaction system was successfully tested in a real-time robot simulation. Initial tests with a real two-arm robot were successfully performed. The evaluation with trained personnel as well as the acceptance study in a nursing home are in preparation.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253782","robotic;dementia;human-robot interaction;Fuzzy Logic;Evolutionary Algorithms","Training;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge based systems;Medical treatment;Real-time systems;Serious games;Personnel","","2","","24","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Persuasive mobile apps incorporate persuasive strategies (PS) that work as backbone mechanics to motivate desired behaviour change. Therefore, we design and evaluate a mobile app called SereneMind following a five-step process. First, we deconstruct the PS operationalized in 150 stress management apps from both Google Play and App Store to identify the most implemented PS using the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) framework. Second, we design a low-fidelity prototype (LFP) depicting various features of the app based on the top ten PS. Third, we conduct a user study involving our target audience to evaluate the perceived persuasiveness/effectiveness of each feature and uncover further improvement based on users' feedback. Fourth, based on our findings from the LFP evaluation, we design a high-fidelity prototype (HFP) using only the features that were perceived as effective by our target audience and applying user suggestions to refine the prototypes. Finally, we run a usability study to evaluate the HFP. Our results show that participants perceived SereneMind as usable and useful for managing stress. Therefore, it is more likely to be adopted and used. Lastly, we offer design recommendations for stress management apps in line with our findings.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253762","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253762","mobile health app;stress management;persuasive strategies;behaviour change;user-centered design;thematic analysis","Persuasive systems;Prototypes;Psychology;Human factors;Mobile applications;Serious games;Internet","","1","","48","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spread of AMR is further accelerated by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. While misuse and overuse of antibiotics are particular global challenges regardless of resources and settings, there is evidence these are amplified in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC) such as Nigeria. While successful antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes have been implemented in LMIC, more research is required to better understand how to overcome some of the underlying reasons and behaviour obstacles, such as lack of training, limited resources, culture and inadequate infection prevention and control practice. This is of particular importance for prophylactic antibiotic prescribing to prevent surgical site infections (SSI). Evidence-based guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies advise on best practice for prescribing and administering prophylactic surgical antibiotics. However, compliance with such guidelines amongst surgical teams is often limited. The development of engaging decision support tools, accessible at the point of care, at low cost for use in LMICs, is required to help surgeons apply AMS guidelines to their daily practice. Serious mobile games, developed with an educational or training purpose rather than for entertainment, are a powerful tool for persuasive behaviour change but little interest has been given to research for AMR to change prescription behaviour in LMIC. In this research we present the co-development of a decision support tool for the “Gamified Antimicrobial Stewardship Decision Support App” (GADSA) in Nigeria with surgeons from three participating hospital sites. GADSA is the first gamified decision support app using persuasive games techniques for prescribing behaviour change demonstrated to deliver a prescription behaviour change increasing compliance with SSI guidelines at the point of care. GADSA is also is novel at providing decision support for surgical antibiotic prescribing through gamified features such instruction of mentor, visual and textual immediate feedback system, persuasive messaging and positive and negative reinforcement.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253775","antibiotic resistance;awareness;games for health;healthcare;serious games","Training;Visualization;Technological innovation;Hospitals;Antibiotics;Point of care;Surgery","","3","","42","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous research has suggested that using full body game controllers in exergames compared to upper body movements has greater potential in producing high levels of exertion. In the present work we explore the impact of using upper compared to full body exergame controllers on players' level of perceived immersion, perceived control, and perceived exertion in the context of casual exergames. A between subject, quasi-experiment was conducted with 80 participants, playing the same casual exergame with either upper body movement controllers or full body movement controllers. The results showed a significant difference between groups in terms of perceived control but not in terms of perceived immersion or perceived exertion.

One of the main advantages of mid- and high-tech products is their ability to adapt to the specific preferences and needs of the user, leading to personalization. This is especially important for children with autism, as their spectrum is very wide. People with autism respond to sensory input differently than typically developing peers. Every child has different sensory characteristics, ranging from hypersensitivity to hyposensitivity in different senses. Thus, for assistive technology products to be successful and comfortable for these users, they must be able to adapt to the special needs and characteristics of each child. This work explores what assistive technology should be able to adapt in terms of sensory characteristics for children with autism and carries out a review to analyze the state of the art of personalization in assistive technology products toward both sensorial profiles (hyper and hyposensitivity). In conclusion, this work observed that although technology is currently being implemented to personalize products to individual senses, there is a lack of assistive products which apply technology for sensorial personalization with a multimodal perspective.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253810","autism spectrum disorder;assistive technology;personalization;adaptability;sensation;perception;children","Autism;Visualization;Pediatrics;Medical treatment;Assistive technologies;Distance measurement;Serious games","","","","35","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, sex education is important, as it increases individuals' knowledge of sexual health, teaches about safe sex practices and healthy sexual behavior, and enables one to make informed decisions. However, in some countries, like India, sex education is highly neglected due to the societal stigma around the topic of sex. Persuasive interventions have shown success in increasing awareness and promoting desired behaviour. However, most of these interventions consider developed countries. This work aims at investigating persuasive intervention for sex education specifically catered to the Indian audience. Particularly, this work discusses using a persuasive mobile app to help individuals learn about sexual health. As a first step to achieving our goal, we designed a prototype for an app called ‘Sex-Educated’ with persuasive features that aim to promote safe sexual practices and increase awareness about risky sexual behaviour among Indian adults. To evaluate the effectiveness of our app with persuasive design and features, we conducted a user study with 57 participants. Our results show that Indian adults are motivated to use a gamified persuasive app for sexual health education. Our app with persuasive features is much more effective to encourage learning, create awareness, and bring about positive attitude and behavioral changes towards sexual health.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253766","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253766","sex education;persuasive strategy;game-based learning;user-centered design","Education;Prototypes;Behavioral sciences;Serious games;Mobile applications","","","","29","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SCT aims to overcome the challenges associated with far transfer, where skills learned in one context may not be effectively applied in another context. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCT, the paper presents a virtual reality game that combines IADLs with cognitive exercises. The game includes four core mechanics: medication management, grocery shopping, breakfast preparation, and city exploration. Each mechanic targets specific IADLs and cognitive functions, such as planning, decision-making, and problem-solving. Future work will involve testing the game with a group of older adults and implementing an adaptive difficulty system based on individual performance. The authors also plan to add additional game mechanics, such as a pill organization task, to further improve IADL performance among older adults. Overall, the SCT represents a promising approach for enhancing the quality of life and independence of older adults.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253789","Activities of Daily Living (ADLs);Structural Cognitive Training (SCT);Virtual Reality (VR);Functional Autonomy;Rehabilitation;Exergame;Head-mounted devices;Older adults","Training;Solid modeling;Adaptive systems;Instruments;Urban areas;Games;Virtual reality","","","","36","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The two serious games were performed twice in a counterbalanced order, and execution time and accuracy were measured. Findings showed that children with ASD were less accurate and took longer to perform the two serious games than their peers with TD. Moreover, no motor learning effect was reported in the serious game that required movements with high-level degrees of freedom, while a motor learning effect was revealed in the game requiring precise goal-directed actions. The children with ASD improved their performance by reducing their execution time across game repetitions. The improvement in time performance did not affect accuracy, which remained stable across repetitions. These findings support the development and implementation of VR-based serious games in ASD intervention, as they could foster motor learning and improve motor skills in this population.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253792","virtual reality;serious games;motor learning;autism spectrum disorder;children","Pediatrics;Autism;Sociology;Virtual reality;Variable speed drives;Time measurement;Serious games","","4","","50","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To evaluate and determine the effectiveness of redirect walking in this scenario, we have created an accessibility-based application. Our experimental results indicate that users in wheelchairs are unable to accurately notice redirection gains from 0.45 up to 1.7. In other words, they cannot distinguish between a physical distance of 1.7m and 0.45m while moving 1m in the virtual world.

To address this gap, we designed ProTaskinator, a persuasive mobile application to help university students reduce procrastination. We used a user-centered design approach which involves iteratively designing low-fidelity prototype, evaluation, and a high-fidelity prototype implementing various evidence-based persuasive strategies. Forty-four (44) university students evaluated the usability of ProTaskinator. Survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess participants' perceived persuasiveness of the app and implemented strategies. Our results revealed that personalization and self-monitoring were the most effective persuasive strategies, and all the implemented strategies were found to be strongly persuasive. Overall, about 80% ($N=35$) of our participants found the app persuasive, easy-to-use, and relevant for reducing procrastination.

In this sense, the development of self-adaptive systems is an alternative that has been explored for these applications. Self-adaptive systems can adapt to changes in context automatically, changing their behavior. However, developing self-adaptive systems is not trivial since, unlike other systems, they must be designed to evolve and adapt their behavior at runtime continuously. In this sense, we propose a Kotlin framework for developing self-adaptive IoHT applications for Android mobile devices called KREATION. This framework was developed using the Model-View-Control architecture and incorporates the MAPE-K adaptation loop into its internal logic. It also presents mechanisms to help collect data from Android smartphone sensors and data from the Google Fit API, which allows you to obtain data collected from other Android devices, such as smart bands and smartwatches.

However, direct (face-to-face) observations of nursing competencies have many inconsistency issues, including quality of assessment (personal judgment), suitability in matching cases (due to complications), manpower and time availability (among assessor, nurses, and cases). The advent of serious games analytics makes it possible to deploy serious games as remote (psychometric) assessment tools. This study assessed the (psychometric) validity and reliability of a Blood Transfusion Serious Game (BTSG) as an assessment tool for measuring nursing competencies in blood transfusion administration. Empirical data (serious games analytics) were collected in situ the game. We evaluated the following psychometric properties, namely: action analysis (using difficulty and discrimination measures), construct validity (through an exploratory factor analysis with principal factor analysis and a Promax rotation), and internal-consistency reliability (via Cronbach's alpha). After removing game actions that were not very discriminating or did not load on a single factor, we found the resulting game to be both internally reliable and valid in measuring six remotely related latent sub constructs.

In this paper, a Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR, where the augmentation of a real environment is based on displays on surfaces instead of being worn by the user) system was used in two conditions characterised by the absence or the presence of a social feature that should improve the user engagement. In the first condition, the subject has to contract the quadriceps of the right leg to command, through EMG sensors, a virtual prosthetic leg to break a virtual wall on a computer screen. In this condition, each foot-wall collision causes a vibratory feedback on the subject's knee, a visual one given by the breaking of the wall, and an auditory one of the sound of falling debris. The second condition, on the other hand, adds a level of sociality whereby the subject must break the virtual wall before a virtual (fictional) competitor. Fourteen unimpaired subjects were administered both conditions in a randomized way, each repeated three times. Questionnaire scores and quantitative data (proprioceptive drift and the number of kicks) have been collected after the training and a subsequent Rubber Leg Illusion session. Overall, it was observed that the competitive condition increased the subject's commitment to completing the task. Although it increases the engagement factor, thus increasing the subject's focus on the task to be performed, the condition in which the social sphere appears negatively impacts the embodiment process itself probably because of the complexity of the task that creates an increase in the subject's distraction and mental workload. However, these results suggest the possibility that an alternation of a neutral and a social task, in the same session, could lead to increased training time and a higher level of limb embodiment.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253816","Istituto nazionale per 1′ assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro (INAIL)(grant numbers:PR19-PAI-P1-HyperLEG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253816","Prosthetics;Embodiment;Virtual Leg Illusion;Rubber Leg Illusion;Lower Limb Prosthesis","Legged locomotion;Training;Visualization;Spatial augmented reality;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Solids;Serious games","","1","","36","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are very few serious games designed for children with CVI and to author's knowledge none of them implements dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). We designed and implemented serious games for high-level visuoperceptual skills (e.g., object recognition, figure ground perception, etc.) training. Moreover, the games have DDA implemented using a reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the game difficulty based on the child's in-game performance.

Exercises within this domain also include using so-called balance boards, requiring patients to step onto them and keep their balance or do specific movements. These often monotonous exercises can lead to patients' non-compliance and therefore take them longer to regain their health, or in the worst case, have long-term issues. These are situations where serious games come into play – delivering entertainment to increase motivation and additional fun features to these monotonous exercises. However, in the context of current solutions for knee rehabilitation, there is a big drawback because additional setup and even (cost-intensive) hardware are required. Therefore, a new serious game was developed together with feedback from involved stakeholders (therapists and patients) also to overcome this current drawback by using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, offering an easy-to-set-up solution containing just a balance board (which people doing knee rehabilitation often already possess) and a smartphone attached to it together with a PC. The evaluation of this solution and setup showed very positive feedback. From a technical point of view, it was shown that the sensors of a plain smartphone (and its sensitivity) paired with a PC and its screen for playing are feasible and can support the knee rehabilitation process by capturing the movements while standing on the balance board.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253768","rehabilitation;knee;serious game","Sensitivity;Entertainment industry;Hardware;Serious games;Sensors;Stakeholders;Injuries","","2","","30","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a web-based application that, given a .csv file containing Heart Rate successive measurements and their respective time stamps, can label sequences of any size that the user specifies.

Methods—Cochrane Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched from January 2018 to May 2022. Selected studies evaluated deep learning (DL) models for image and video analysis of laparoscopic surgery. Comparisons were made of the studies' characteristics such as the dataset source, type of laparoscopic operation, number of images/videos, and types of neural networks (NN) used. Results—22 out of 152 studies identified met the selection criteria. The application with the greatest number of studies was instrument detection (59.1%) and the second was instrument segmentation (40.9%). The most tested procedure was cholecystectomy (72.73%). Conclusions—Although CNN-based algorithms outperform other methods in instrument detection and many have been proposed, there are still challenging conditions where numerous difficulties arise. U-Nets are the dominant force in the field for segmentation, but other models such as Mask R-CNN follow close behind with comparable results. Deep learning holds immense potential in laparoscopic surgery and many improvements are expected as soon as data quality improves.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253772","Artificial Intelligence;Deep Learning;Computer Vision;Laparoscopy tools","Deep learning;Laparoscopes;Training;Image segmentation;Minimally invasive surgery;Systematics;Instruments","","","","40","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We found that although participants experienced psychophysical effects in both setups, this was significantly lower for the virtual reality setup. Additionally, participants found the system easy to use, but the virtual reality environment scored low in terms of experienced realism which could have attributed to the lower number of psychophysical effects in the virtual reality setup.

Rehabilitation in both the cognitive and motor domains is key to comprehensive treatment of the impairments of MS patients. Since the effectiveness of rehabilitation is related to the levels of patients' motivation and engagement, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to keep patients engaged during rehabilitation. In recent years, several serious games in Virtual Reality (VR) have been developed for rehabilitation purposes, holding promise to enhance traditional approaches with gamified and entertaining environments. These technologies pave the way to increase motivation during rehabilitation sessions and thus promote training effectiveness. This paper presents an immersive video game that transfers traditional rehabilitation exercises into a playful and engaging context. The game combines Upper Limb (UL) motor activities with cognitive tasks and suggests different exercises targeting a variety of rehabilitation scopes. A biofeedback system based on heart rate data is integrated into the game to adapt the difficulty level of the game to the player's condition in real time. The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate the usability of the developed game and to observe the effects of the biofeedback on the player's engagement during the game. The main finding of this study is that the biofeedback significantly increases mental focus on the game tasks and thus has a great potential to improve engagement in the rehabilitation session. The game is very well-accepted by healthy subjects and by one MS patient, suggesting its potential suitability for use in rehabilitation settings. Future studies will involve a larger cohort of MS patients to further evaluate its relevance and appropriateness in rehabilitation trainings.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253757","Politecnico di Torino; European Union; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253757","Exergames;Rehabilitation;Multiple Sclerosis;Cognitive Rehabilitation;Upper Limb;Dual Task;Virtual Reality;Biofeedback","Training;Heart rate;Video games;Games;Virtual reality;Pulse width modulation;Biological control systems","","1","","25","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods: The comparison was achieve by conducting a randomized controlled trial. This trial involved 42 undergraduate medical students. First they participated in a conventional class of 45 minutes about “the recommendation for the transportation of the critically ill patients”, followed by a pre-test. Students were assigned at random to the control, video, and game groups, where they either watched instructive videos or played a serious game. After four weeks of exposure, a retention-test, containing the same questions of the pre-test, was administer to the video and game groups. The students also performed a survey eliciting students' perceptions, expectations and satisfaction regarding serious games. Knowledge test scores were analysed by the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The survey was descriptively analyzed. Results: The retention-test results showed that both instructional strategies (game and video) have achieved a slightly higher level of knowledge retention than the control group and in particular in the group that watched the video. Nevertheless, doing a between group analysis, no statistically significant difference ($p=0.5$) was observed for groups when comparing results obtained in the two points of assessment and teaching method. However, within-group comparison showed that there is a statistical significance when comparing the difference between pre/retention-test results for the instructional strategies (game and video, with $p=0.001$ and $p=0.002$, respectively), while this was not verified for the conventional class ($p > 0.06$). Conclusion: Results indicate improvement in students' previous knowledge for both instructional strategies, in particular in the group that combined face-to-face and video class.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253791","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia(grant numbers:UIDB/00711/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253791","Serious Games;Instructional Strategies;Randomized Controlled Trial;Knowledge Retention;Medical Education","Surveys;Education;Transportation;Serious games","","","","32","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analyzing the feedback, we found evidence for a significant heterogeneity of the target group resulting in different individual needs. Based on the data, we furthermore derived recommendations for design and pedagogical elements that an assistive application for ADHD families should include to embrace the unique needs of this target group. Our results highlight the importance of self-determination in motivating children and parents to engage in mental health interventions. In addition, to our knowledge, we have developed the first ADHD-specific application that involves children and parents equally, which seems to align with the needs of the families.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-4607-7","10.1109/SeGAH57547.2023.10253776","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(grant numbers:EFRE-0801423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253776","ADHD;Designing Assistive Technology;Mobile Health Applications;Design Recommendations;Self-determination theory","Training;Pediatrics;Mental health;Serious games;Testing","","","","22","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
